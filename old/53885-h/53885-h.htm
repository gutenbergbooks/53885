COURAGE</h1>




<h2 style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Pierre Gourdon</span> had the love of God in his
heart, a man's love for a man's God, and it
seemed to him that in this golden sunset of a July
afternoon the great Canadian wilderness all about him
was whispering softly the truth of his faith and his
creed. For Pierre was the son of a runner of the
streams and forests, as that son's father had been
before him, and love of adventure ran in his blood, and
romance, too; so it was only in the wild and silent
places that he felt the soul in him attuned to that fellowship
with nature which the good teachers at Ste.
Anne de Beaupré did not entirely approve. Nature
was Pierre's God, and would ever be until he died. And
though he had crept up the holy stair at Ste. Anne's
on his knees, and had touched the consecrated water
from the sacred font, and had looked with awe upon
mountains of canes and crutches left by those who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
come afflicted and doubting and had departed cured
and believing, still he was sure that in this sunset of a
certain July afternoon he was nearer to the God he
desired than at any other time in all his life.</p>

<p>Josette, his wife, slender and tired, her dark head
bare in the fading sun, stood wistful and hoping at
his side, praying gently that at last their long wanderings
up the St. Lawrence and along this wilderness
shore of Superior had come to an end, and that they
might abide in this new paradise, and never travel again
until the end of their days.</p>

<p>Back of them, where a little stream ran out of the
cool forest, a tireless boy quested on hands and knees
in the ferns and green grass for wild strawberries, and
though strawberry season was late his mouth was
smeared red.</p>

<p>The man said, pointing down, "It makes one almost
think the big lake is alive, and a hand is reaching in
for him."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are Five Fingers of water reaching in
from the lake," agreed Josette, seating herself wearily
upon a big stone, "though it seems to me there should
be only four fingers, and one thumb."</p>

<p>And so the place came to be named, and through all
the years that have followed since that day it has tenaciously
clung to its birthright.</p>

<p>The boy came to his mother, bringing her strawberries
to eat; and the man, climbing a scarp of rock,
made a megaphone of his hands and hallooed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
it until an answering shout came from deep in the
spruces and balsams, and a little later Dominique
Beauvais came out to the edge of the slope, his
whiskered face bright with expectancy, and with him
his little wife Marie, panting hard to keep pace with
his long legs.</p>

<p>When they were together Pierre Gourdon made a
wide and all-embracing sweep with his arms.</p>

<p>"This will be a good place to live in," he said. "It
is what we have been looking for."</p>

<p>With enthusiasm Dominique agreed. The women
smiled. Again they were happy. The boy was hunting
for strawberries. He was always empty, this boy.</p>

<p>Pierre Gourdon kissed his wife's smooth hair as
they went back to the camp they had made two hours
earlier in the day, and broke into a wild boat song which
his grandfather had taught him on his knee in the
wicked days before he had known Josette at Ste.
Anne, and Dominique joined in heartily through his
whiskers.</p>

<p>The women's smiles were sweeter and their eyes
brighter, for fatigue seemed to have run away from
them now that their questing men-folk were satisfied
and had given them a promise of home.</p>

<p>That night, after supper, with their green birch
camp-fire lighting up the blackness of the wilderness,
they sat and made plans, and long after nine-year-old
Joe had crawled into his blanket to sleep, and the
women's eyes were growing soft with drowsiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Pierre and Dominique continued to smoke pipefuls of
tobacco and to build over and over the homes of their
dreams.</p>

<p>Young and happy, and overflowing with the adventurous
enthusiasm of the race of <i>coureurs</i> from which
they had sprung, they saw themselves with the rising
of another sun pitched into the heart of realities which
they had anticipated for a long time; and when at last
Josette fell asleep, her head pillowed close to her boy's,
her red lips that had not lost their prettiness through
motherhood and wandering were tender with a new
peace and contentment. And a little later, while Pierre
and Dominique still smoked and painted their futures,
the moon rose over the forest-tops in a great golden
welcome to the pioneers, and the wind came in softly
and more coolly from the lake, and at the last, from
far away, rose faintly a wilderness note that thrilled
them&mdash;the cry of wolves.</p>

<p>Dominique listened, and silently emptied the ash
from his pipe into the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"Where wolves run there is plenty of game, and
where there is game there is trapping," he said.</p>

<p>And then came a sound which stopped the hearts of
both for an instant, a deep and murmuring echo, faint
and very far, that broke in a note of strange and vital
music upon the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>"A ship!" whispered Pierre.</p>

<p>"Yes, a ship!" repeated Dominique, half rising to
catch the last of the sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>For this was a night of forty years ago, when on the
north shore of Superior the cry of wolves in the forest
was commoner than the blast of a ship's whistle at
sea.</p>

<p>The pioneers slept. The yellow moon climbed up
until it was straight overhead. Shadows in the deep
forest moved like living things. The wolves howled,
circled, came nearer, and stopped their cry where the
kill was made. Mellow darkness trembled and thrilled
with life. Silent-winged creatures came and disappeared
like ghosts. Bright eyes watched the sleeping
camp of the home seekers. A porcupine waddled
through it, chuckling and complaining in his foolish
way. A buck caught the scent of it, stamped his
foot and whistled. There were whisperings in the tall,
dark spruce tops.</p>

<p>Caverns of darkness gave out velvety footfalls of
life, and little birds that were silent in the day uttered
their notes softly in the moon glow.</p>

<p>A bar of this light lay across Josette's face, softening
it and giving to its beauty a touch of something
divine. The boy was dreaming. Pierre slept
with his head pillowed in the crook of his arm.
Dominique's whiskers were turned to the sky, bristling
and fierce, as if he had taken this posture to
guard against harm the tired little wife who lay at his
side.</p>

<p>So the night passed, and dawn came, wakening them
with the morning chatter of a multitude of red squirrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in a little corner of the world as yet unspoiled
by man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That first day from which they began to measure
their new lives the axes of Pierre and Dominique struck
deep into the sweetly scented hearts of the cedar trees
out of which they were to build their homes at Five
Fingers. But first they looked more carefully into
the prospects of their domain.</p>

<p>The forest was back of them, a forest of high ridges
and craggy ravines, of hidden meadows and swamps, a
picturesque upheaval of wild country which reached for
many miles from the Superior shore to the thin strip
of settlement lands along the Canadian Pacific. Black
and green and purple with its balsam, cedar and
spruce, silver and gold with its poplar and birch,
splashed red with mountain ash, its climbing billows
and dripping hollows were radiantly tinted by midsummer
sun&mdash;and darkly sullen and mysterious under cloud
or storm. Out of these fastnesses, choked with ice and
snow in winter, Pierre knew how the floods must come
roaring in springtime, and his heart beat exultantly,
for he loved the rush and thunder of streams, and the
music of water among rocks.</p>

<p>At the tip of the longest of the five inlets which
broke like gouging fingers through the rock walls of
the lake half a mile away they decided upon the sites for
their cabins. Against those walls they could hear
faintly the moaning of surf, never quite still even when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
there was no whisper of wind. But the long finger of
water, narrow and twisted, as if broken at the joint,
was a placid pool of green and silver over which the
gulls floated, calling out their soft notes in welcome to
the home builders, and in its white sand were the prints
of many feet, both of birds and of beasts, who played
and washed themselves there, and came down to drink.
Between these two, the open and peaceful serenity of
the inlet and the cool, still hiding-places of the forest,
were the green meadowland and slopes and patches of
level plain, a narrow strip of park-like beauty at the
upper edge of which, in the very shadow of the
forest, Pierre and Dominique struck off their plots
and squared their angles, making ready for the logs
in which the afternoon saw their axes buried.</p>

<p>The days passed. Each dawn the red squirrel chorus
greeted the rising sun; through hours that followed
came the ring of steel and the freedom of voice which
is born of love and home. Pierre sang, as his grandfather
had sung long years ago, and Dominique bellowed
like a baying hound when the chorus came.
Women's laughter rose with the singing of the birds.
Josette and Marie were girls again, and the boy was
forever leading them to newly discovered strawberry
patches hidden among the rocks and grass and
ferns.</p>

<p>It was a new thing for the wilderness, this invasion
of human life, and for a long time it fell away from
them, listening, frightened and subdued. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
birds and the red squirrels gave it courage, and softly
it returned, curious and shy and friendly. The deer
came down to drink again in the dusk, and moose
rattled their antlers up the ridge. Pop-eyed whisky
jacks began to eat bannock crumbs close to Josette's
hands. Jays came nearer to scream their defiance, like
wild Indians, in the tree-tops, and thrushes and warblers
sang until their throats were ready to burst, and
twenty times a day Pierre would pause in his labor
and say, "This is going to be a fine place to live in,
with the sea at our front door and the woods at our
back."</p>

<p>He called Superior "the sea," and twice in the first
week they saw far out in its hazy vastness white and
shimmering specks which were sailing ships.</p>

<p>Log upon log the first of the cabins rose, until the
roof was covered, and scarcely was it done when
Josette and Marie were planting wild morning glories
and crimson splashes of roses about it, and were
digging in the dark, cool mold of birch and poplar
thickets for violet roots, and out in the sheltered fens
and meadow-dips for hyacinths and fire-flowers; and
in the hour before dusk, when the day's work was over
and supper was eaten, they would go hand in hand
with their men-folk to study and ponder over the fertile
patches of earth here and there where next spring they
would plant potatoes and carrots and turnips and all
the other fine things they had known back in the land
of Ste. Anne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>It was August when the two cabins were finished,
small in dimensions but snug as dovecotes, and in the
eyes of Josette and Marie grew a deeper and more
serious look. For they were housewives again, with
little to do with, but with a world full of endeavor and
anticipation ahead of them. And it worried them to
see that the fruits were ripening, red raspberries so
thick the bears were turning into hulks of fat, black
currants and saskatoons among the rocks, and all over
the ridgesides great trees of wild plums and mountain
ash berries, waiting for the first frosts to make them
ready for preserves and jams.</p>

<p>So Dominique, one day, set out to blaze a trail to the
nearest settlement, thirty miles away; and thereafter
their men-folk took turns, one and then the other,
going with empty pack and returning with sixty pounds
of burden, and berries were put into cans and dried and
preserved&mdash;until Pierre and Dominique began to tease
their wives and ask them if they wanted their husbands
to turn into bears and sleep on their fat all winter. It
was this banter which reminded Josette of candles, and
in September they killed two bears and made several
hundred of them.</p>

<p>With the first frosts of autumn Pierre said even more
frequently than before, "This is a fine place to live in,"
and Josette and Marie, seeing what the frosts were
doing, rose each morning with new wonder and new
joy in their eyes. For if these frosts were giving to
the waters of the lake a colder and harder sheen, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
something of menace and gloom about it, they were
also painting the ridges and hollows and all the forest
land as far as they could see with a glory of color
which they had never known at Ste. Anne.</p>

<p>Breath of winter came in the nights. Higher grew
the great birch piles of firewood which Pierre and
Dominique dragged close to the cabin doors, and very
soon came the days when the carnival of autumn color
was gone and all but the evergreen trees assumed the
ragged distress of naked limbs and branches, and
winds broke down fiercely over the wilderness, and the
moan of the lake, beating against its rock walls, grew
clearer and at times was a muffled and sullen roar half
a mile away.</p>

<p>But these changes were not frightening to Pierre and
his people. Canadian winter was, after all, the heart
of their lives; long months of adventure and thrill of
deep snows and stinging blizzards on the trap lines, of
red-hot stoves, and snug evenings at home telling the
tales of the day, and appetites as keen as the winds
that howled down from the north.</p>

<p>This season, of all seasons, they would not have
changed. It was then the wolf howl took on a new
note, the foxes cried out hungrily at the edge of the
clearing in the night. The call of the moose floated
awesomely through the frost of still evenings, and the
bears hunted their dens. One after another songbirds
departed, leaving the whisky jacks and the jays behind,
and the ravens gathered in flocks, while in the thickets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and swamps the big snowshoe rabbits turned from
brown to gray and from gray to white. All hunting
things were astir, from the wolf and the fox and the
little outlaw ermine to the owl and the dog-faced fisher-cat,
and in November Pierre and Dominique dipped
their traps in hot bear grease and prayed for the first
snow.</p>

<p>It came in the night, so quietly that none heard the
breathless fall of it, and the world was white when
little Joe got out of his bed at dawn to look at his rabbit
snares in the edge of the timber. That was the
beginning of their first winter at Five Fingers. It was
a cold, dry winter, and there was never a day that a
haunch of venison or moose meat was not hanging
behind the cabins. Trapping was good, and the store
of pelts grew as the weeks went on, until Pierre and
Dominique both swore in the same breath that it was
a paradise that they had found on this north shore of
Superior, and each day they made new promises of
what they would buy for Josette and Marie in the
spring. The snow piled itself deeper, and the lake
froze over. In January it was thirty degrees below
zero.</p>

<p>The white world, Josette called it, and at times they
all played in it like children. There was Christmas, and
then New Year's, and a birthday for Marie, and games
and stories at night round the crackling stoves in the
cabins. Pierre and Dominique built toboggans, and
from the crest of the ridge where they had first looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
down upon the Five Fingers they sped in wild races
over the open and halfway across the snow-crusted ice
of the middle finger. And yet when Dominique came
in one day and said quite casually that he had heard
the chirp of a brush warbler back in the big swamp
Marie gave a little cry of delight and Josette's eyes grew
suddenly bright.</p>

<p>It meant spring. A day or two later Pierre said the
coats of the snowshoe rabbits were turning rusty, which
meant early spring. Then came discovery of the first
bear track, the track of a foolish bear who had come
out hungrily, like a woodchuck, only to hunt himself
a den again when he saw his shadow freezing in the
snow. After this there was more sun in the morning
and less of the cold of sullen twilight each night, and
before even the crust of the snow had begun to thaw
Pierre brought in a poplar twig to show how the buds
were swelling until they seemed ready to pop. "I
have never seen them fatter," he said. "It means spring
isn't far away."</p>

<p>When the first robin came Josette told her husband
she could already smell the perfume of flowers. He
was a cold-footed and crabbed-looking bird, forlorn
and disappointed at the world's chill aspect, and for a
few minutes he sat humped up on the roof log and then
flew away.</p>

<p>This was the beginning. The snow began to thaw on
the sunny sides of the slopes, and after that the change
came swiftly. In April a steady and swelling murmur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ran through the forests, the music of the gathering
waters. Meadows and flats became flooded, little creeks
changed suddenly into rushing torrents, lakes and
ponds crept up over their sides, and the tiny stream
which passed near the cabins, quiet and gentle in summertime,
was all at once a riotous and quarrelsome outlaw,
roaring and foaming in its mad rush down to
the Middle Finger. Half a mile away was a larger
stream whose flood sounds came to them like the
distant roar of a cataract. It was glorious music, with
something in it that stirred the blood of Pierre and
his people like tonic and wine. Pierre, in his optimism
and love of life, explained it all by saying, "It is good
to have a long, cold winter that we may fully enjoy
the spring."</p>

<p>The birds seemed to return in a night and a day&mdash;robins
perky and glad to get back from the lazy southland,
thrushes and catbirds and a dozen kinds of little
brown warblers and brush sparrows whose voices were
sweetest of all the spring songsters. The earth itself
began to breathe with swelling roots and tips of green;
the first flowers popped up; the poplar buds exploded
into fuzzy leaves, and Pierre and Dominique worked
from morning until night, clearing the patches they
were to plant this year, and spading up the rich, dark
soil.</p>

<p>It was about this time Pierre gave voice to a
thought which had been growing in his head all winter.
He was standing with Josette at the tip of the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ridge from which they had first looked down upon
Five Fingers.</p>

<p>"Ste. Anne was never as fine as this, <i>chérie</i>," he said.</p>

<p>"No, not even before the woods were cut," agreed
Josette.</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it softly in his own, and
Josette laid her cheek against his shoulder so that his
lips could touch her smooth hair. Pierre always liked
it that way.</p>

<p>"I have been having a dream," he said, his voice a
little queer because of its secret, and because he knew
how its confession would thrill the one at his side,
"and I have said nothing about it, but have done much
thinking. Would not a little church look pretty down
there, just where the tip of the evergreen forest
reaches to the Middle Finger?"</p>

<p>"A church!" whispered Josette, her heart giving a
sudden swift beat.</p>

<p>"Yes, a church," chuckled Pierre softly. "And over
there, in that green bit of meadow&mdash;what a place for a
home for our old friend Poleon Dufresne, and Sara,
and all the children. And there is room for the
Clamarts, too, and Jean Croisset and his wife. It is
a big land, with plenty of fur and game and good rich
soil underfoot, and I have thought it is not right to
keep it all to ourselves, <i>douce amie</i>."</p>

<p>From the door of her cabin some distance away
Marie Beauvais wondered just why it was that Josette
threw her arms so suddenly round her husband's neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and kissed him. And Pierre, with a heart full of
happiness, little guessed that with the fulfilment of his
dreams would come tragedy into the wilderness paradise
at Five Fingers.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was five years later that Simon McQuarrie and
Herman Vogelaar came to Five Fingers. They
were a queer but lovable combination. Simon was a
Scotchman, tall and spare, with a thin face which
seldom broke into a smile and which had the appearance
of being made of flint. His companion was a
Dutchman, short and round as a dumpling, with a
pink, smooth face, light blue eyes and a great habit of
puffing when he exerted himself a little, which came,
Simon said, from overeating. They had been boys
together more than thirty years ago in a little Ontario
town, and now they were partners, timber-looking,
prospecting and bartering and saving a little money
as the years went on. Herman was a widower, and
his only daughter, Geertruda, had married Jeremie
Poulin back in Quebec, and Jeremie was a cousin of
the Clamarts and lived now at Five Fingers. It was
Herman's first visit. He had come to see the new
baby and had brought Simon along with him.</p>

<p>The instant Simon's shrewd eyes came upon the
clearing and the little settlement, with the fingers
of water reaching in from the big lake, he began having
thoughts which he did not at once announce to Herman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The years had brought changes to Five Fingers.
The single-room cabins which Pierre and Dominique
had built were gone, and in their places stood larger
buildings of clean-cut and nicely squared logs, with
flowers and garden plots around them, and rows of
smooth stones painted white. Josette, now almost
forty, was still slim and pretty, and Pierre was more
than ever her lover, in spite of a great disappointment
which he kept shut up in his own heart. He wanted
children. His love for them was a passion, but for
him stalwart young Joe, now fourteen years old, was
the first and the last. Pierre had implicit faith in
prayer, and ever since that first summer at Five
Fingers he had prayed devoutly that God might send
more children.</p>

<p>And God answered, though somewhere there was a
slip that puzzled Pierre, for the more he prayed the
more children came to Dominique and Marie. First
there was a pair of them, Louis and Julie, then three
singles as regularly as could be&mdash;Aimé and Félipe and
Dominique&mdash;and with each one of them Marie grew
plumper and jollier and began questing about in her
head for a name to be given the next.</p>

<p>But Pierre was happy, for if they were not entirely
his own there were at least children all about him.
Poleon and Sara Dufresne had come with three children
and had built their cabin a stone's throw away;
Jeremie and Geertruda had a baby, and at the edge of
the green bit of meadow which he had pointed out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Josette five years ago were the homes of Jean Croisset
and Telesphore Clamart, and Aleck Clamart was courting
Anne Croisset. With Pierre he was secretly making
plans for a home the following year, after one more
season of trapping.</p>

<p>And right at the tip of the evergreen forest, where
Pierre had promised, was the little log church in which
they gathered each Sunday, and to which Father Albanel,
a wandering minister of the forests, came once
and sometimes twice a month.</p>

<p>As the population had grown, so had the clearing
expanded. There were a good dozen acres or more
under careful tillage, and in the open were cattle and
several horses, and in every wild meadow for miles
about a stack of harvested hay in season. There were
chickens and geese and a community flock of turkeys,
and at all seasons plenty of eggs and milk and cream
and the sweet butter, and the dug-out cellars were filled
to the brim with good things to eat when the first cold
blasts of winter came. Pierre and Aleck had built a
boat, and the six families had combined in the purchase
of two nets, so there was no lack of fish either winter or
summer at Five Fingers.</p>

<p>For two winters, much against his desire, young Joe
had been sent back over the new Canadian Pacific to
attend school at Ste. Anne.</p>

<p>Simon McQuarrie made note of all these things with
the judgment of a fox and the keenness of a weasel.
No one would have judged Simon for what he really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was, at least not on short acquaintance. In him was
a heart so honest he would have cut off a little finger
before taking a mean advantage of any other man or
woman. But, as Herman put it, he was always looking
around to see what he could pick up. Herman furnished
the laughter, the jollity, the never-ending good
humor and four-fifths of the stomach of the partnership,
and Simon was the ferret who smelled out the
dollars; so when Simon said one day, "I never knew a
better place than this for a little mill, Herman," the
proud grandfather of baby Tobina knew something
was in the air.</p>

<p>First of all, with his native shrewdness, Simon took
stock of the happiness at Five Fingers. This contentment,
the community affection which brought all
together like members of one family, was a big asset
in the very beginning. The mill itself could be made a
sort of family affair, and a boat arranged for twice or
three times a year to run up from Duluth or Fort William
and carry away the lumber. There was enough
fine birch and cedar and spruce right about them to
keep going for years, and the mill would bring even
greater prosperity than trapping, which was sure to
wear out now that the settlements were filling up
rapidly along the line of the railroad.</p>

<p>At last he talked over the matter with Pierre, and
Pierre called in Dominique, and there was a meeting
of all the men-folk of the families at which it was
agreed nothing could be finer for Five Fingers than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mill. Simon promised the first thing to be made from
its lumber should be a schoolhouse, and they would have
to see to it the schoolhouse had a teacher, for if
Dominique and Jeremie and Poleon kept up the pace
they were going there surely must be teaching at Five
Fingers.</p>

<p>This was on Saturday. The next day Father
Albanel came, a little, gray-haired, rosy-cheeked man
who loved life and all living things, and who had no settled
church because he saw in nature a greater God than
he had ever been able to find in the Book written by
man, a freedom of thought which had been labeled
heresy by those who traveled the old and unchangeable
paths. But Father Albanel was loved by every man,
woman and child who knew him, and while his stricter
brethren chanted and prayed in their vaulted cathedrals
and little mission houses, his Church was ten thousand
square miles of forest land. And on this Sunday
Father Albanel prayed that Simon McQuarrie might
be able to keep his promises.</p>

<p>So the mill came. There was not much to it, but
when on a certain September afternoon a tug and a
scow came creeping up the middle inlet every soul in
Five Fingers was down to meet them, and every heart
was beating with the biggest excitement that had ever
come into the lives of Pierre and his people. With the
tug came Simon McQuarrie, proud as an admiral in
command of a fleet, and with him a Norwegian
engineer and his wife, two mill-hands, and a sallow-faced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
anemic-looking young man who was to teach
Jeremie Poulin's children and Dominique's kindergarten
during the winter for fifteen dollars a month
and board.</p>

<p>The mill was set up, with only pieces of tarpaulin for
roof at first. Axes rang merrily in the woods, and the
three horses at Five Fingers dragged in the logs at the
ends of chains. Even the women were excited, and the
children waited eagerly for the set day when smoke
would pour from the tall boiler stack and the saws
would begin to hum and grind. This happened on the
fifth day, and when at last steam was up, and the long
belt began to turn, and the big, shining saw to whirl,
there rose a great hurrah, and even Baby Tobina waved
her tiny fists and crowed as loudly as she could. Then
the sharp teeth of the saw touched the end of the first
log, and there came the first of that beautiful, droning
song&mdash;the song of live steel cutting through sweet
wood&mdash;which was to last for many years at Five
Fingers, and which may be heard at times to this very
day.</p>

<p>No one, not even his sweetheart wife, Josette, was
permitted to look deeply and completely into the heart
of Pierre. As time passed he saw his beloved forest
dragged in, a log at a time, to be cut into pieces by that
droning, merciless saw. He watched the life's blood
of the timber pile up in great golden heaps of sweet-smelling
sawdust in which the growing children loved
to play, and down on the shore he saw his wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
garnered in huge piles of boards, waiting for the little
black tugs to come in and drag them away. He knew
that it was all as it should be, for new prosperity came
with the mill, more comforts and happiness for the
women and children, and a few more people to Five
Fingers. This was progress. Yet an ache was in his
heart which he kept to himself, and which would never
quite die away. For with a passion next to his love for
children he loved his forests, and with him every tree
was a word of God.</p>

<p>Yet he would not have changed conditions, for he
knew it was himself who was wrong. Everything told
him that. Even the wild things seemed to love this
more intimate companionship with man, for the birds
and squirrels were never more numerous about Five
Fingers. They sang and chattered with the music of
the mill, ran over the roofs of the houses and built their
nests under the eaves, and in winter came to the very
doorsteps to eat crumbs and grain thrown out for them.
It was Pierre whose word was unwritten law at Five
Fingers. One of his laws was that no living thing that
was not a pest should ever be harmed near the settlement,
and when ice and snow were heavy in the hills
and between the ridges deer came out shyly to eat with
the cattle.</p>

<p>Pierre went no more on the trap line but attended to
the business of the mill, and Josette pleased him by
saying this made her happiness complete. In spare
hours one could always find children about him, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the evenings, when the droning of the mill saw had
ceased, there were games and races and fun among the
sawdust piles, and never a day passed that the home of
Pierre and Josette was not filled with childish laughter
and the patter of little feet, although the little girl they
prayed for never came to bear their name. "But she
will," said Pierre, keeping up that undying hope in his
heart. "Some day, my Josette, there will come a little
girl to be a sister to Joe."</p>

<p>Even Joe, his one child, seemed to be getting farther
away from him, for as time passed the boy needed no
urging to return to Ste. Anne, but was restless and ill
at ease when back home from school, and was excited
when the day drew near that would take him from Five
Fingers again. He was eighteen when Josette learned
his secret, and she laughed softly, and kissed him, and
told Pierre so that he would not worry any more. The
girl was none other than Marie Antoinette, the beautiful
little daughter of Jacques Thiebout, whom they
had known years ago on the St. Lawrence. She was a
year younger than Joe, and had told him he must wait
until she had finished completely with the school of Ste.
Anne de la Perade, for that was her ambition, and her
father's, too. Then she would come with him to Five
Fingers.</p>

<p>Tears of joy filled Pierre's eyes the night Josette
whispered the secret to him, for if the little girl they
both wanted persisted in not coming they would at least
have grandsons and granddaughters to make up for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it may be this is the answer to my prayers,"
Pierre said to himself. "For Joe's children will be of
our own flesh and blood, and we shall love Marie
Antoinette as our own. And as Joe is younger and
stronger than Dominique, who is growing fat, I do
not see why he should fall behind him in the matter of
family."</p>

<p>Few changes came to Five Fingers as the years rolled
on. The little mill continued to hum and the axes to
ring farther and farther back in the forest, and twice
or three times in a season the boat came up with loads
of supplies and carried away the lumber.</p>

<p>Not a single year did the stork fail to build his nest
somewhere about the sawdust piles. Twice he visited
Aleck Clamart, who married Anne Croisset; two little
Dutchmen he brought to Geertruda Poulin, and there
were nine pairs of feet to shoe in the home of
Dominique and Marie when young Joe Gourdon
brought Marie Antoinette to Five Fingers as his wife.</p>

<p>The mill did not run that day, for it was a day of
feasting and rejoicing, and all the world held no
prouder monarch than Joe. Marie Antoinette, tall and
slim, with her great dark eyes, her glad smile and her
outreaching arms of love for the people who had now
become her own, was as sweet and beautiful as his
mother had been in the days of her youth. And Pierre,
in his joy, found in her a rival, for the children
gathered round her in dumb worship, and in her pretty
arms Marie Antoinette gathered every one, kissing each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in turn, even to bashful Louis, the eldest son of
Dominique. And when, in their cabin, she flung those
same pretty arms around Josette's neck and called her
Mother, Pierre winked hard and went outside to puff
at his pipe, for he felt like a boy who wanted to cry.</p>

<p>God had been good to him. God had blessed Five
Fingers. In the going down of the sun his eyes rested
upon a green slope where no plow had touched and no
cabin had been built. Religiously that sacred little plot
had been held for the time when death might find its
way among them. And death had not come. Gratitude
welled up in Pierre's heart and choked him&mdash;gratitude
and pride and faith, for all this was the handiwork
of the great and good God he believed in, the God of
his forests, the open, the sun and the sky. And the
thought came to him that when at last there was a
break in the little green slope it was only right that he
should be the first to go, for God had filled his measure
to the brim, and it seemed to him he could hear the
whisper of a message from the violets and red roses of
that little knoll in the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette, coming to him so quietly he did
not hear, put her little hand in his and whispered, "It
is beautiful here, my father!"</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> long as men remain to tell the story of the Inland
Seas the great autumn storm of 1900 will
not be forgotten. It has been set down as a matter of
history, and a hundred tales could be told of the ships
that went down and the men who died in those days
when the Five Lakes were like five mighty churns,
whipping and tossing their waters in maelstroms of
destruction.</p>

<p>It was not cold. A part of the time the sun shone
brightly, and back in the woods from the Superior
shore birds sang, and flowers still bloomed. To Pierre
and his people this was of strange and mysterious
portent, for though they had seen many storms at Five
Fingers there had never been one like this, with that
terrific roar of enraged waters against rock walls and
birds preening themselves and chirping in the sunshine
of the forest.</p>

<p>On the second day Pierre took Josette and Marie
Antoinette down to the tip of the wooded peninsula that
lay between the Second and Middle Finger that they
might see the lake as they had never seen it before. It
was fun for the women. The wind choked them at
times, and they had to scream to be heard, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
whipped their long hair loose until they were like panting
naiads, clinging to Pierre's hands, their eyes shining
and their hearts thrilled with the excitement of the
adventure. Pierre, laughing, told Josette she was as
lovely as a girl with her shining hair all about her in a
windblown tangle and her cheeks as pink and soft as
Marie Antoinette's. But he was only half heard, for
the seas were roaring among the rocks below them like
the steady thunder of countless guns.</p>

<p>When they came out of the last rim of sheltering
spruce and looked beyond the black and dripping rampart
of rock that held back the raging waters Josette
clung to him in sudden fear, and Marie Antoinette gave
a cry that cut like a knife above the wind.</p>

<p>Pierre's heart went dead and still as he stared gray-faced
out to sea. There was a twist on his lips where
laughter suddenly died.</p>

<p>Out from the shore lay an entanglement of reef and
rock, jutting up like great heads of sea-monsters in
the quiet and calm of summer, a resting-place for gulls,
and strangely quiet and beautiful at times when the
water rippled between them in wide paths of green
silver. Through this network of waiting traps ran the
channel in which the tug made her way to and from
the Middle Finger. But there was no channel today.
It was lost in a fury of thundering flood, lashing itself
into ribbons, and among the rocks, half a mile from
where Pierre and his women stood, a ship was beating
herself to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>In his first moment of horror Pierre knew they had
come just in time to see the end. She was a schooner
of possibly three hundred tons, and had plunged broadside
upon the long, low reef which Josette herself had
named the Dragon because of the jagged teeth of rock
which rose from it like the spines of a huge fin. Her
tall masts were gone. A mass of wreckage tangled her
deck, and Pierre fancied that even above the roar of
the surf he could hear the crash of her rending timbers
as she rose and fell in mighty sledge-hammer blows
upon the reef. As he waited, struck dumb with horror,
the vessel was raised half out of the sea, and when she
fell back her stern split asunder and the foaming water
engulfed her until only her bow was held up by the projecting
spines of the Dragon.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette cried out again, and her face was
waxlike in its fear and horror, for very clearly in that
moment they saw a moving figure in the bow of the
ship. In an instant the figure was inundated and gone.</p>

<p>Life leaped back into Pierre.</p>

<p>"If any live they may sweep into this pit of the
Middle Finger," he shouted. "We must help them."
Then he turned to Marie Antoinette and placed his
mouth close to her ear. "Go back," he cried. "Go back
and bring help as swiftly as you can!"</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words spoken when Marie
Antoinette was gone with the quickness of a bird, her
long hair streaming about her like a veil as she ran.
Pierre looked at Josette. She was not frightened now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Her face was white and calm and her eyes were pools
of steady fire. She was looking on death. She could
almost hear the cries of death. Her glance met
Pierre's, and her lips moved, but he did not hear her
words. It was then, looking again toward what little
remained of the schooner, that they saw something
sweeping in toward them among the nearer reefs. It
came swiftly, now almost submerged, then popping up
for an instant, and was swept at last upon a rock where
the waters split like a mill race at the very edge of the
smoother sea that ran through the mouth of the Middle
Finger.</p>

<p>"It is a raft," shouted Pierre, "and someone is on
it!"</p>

<p>Josette's cry rose shrill and piercing:</p>

<p>"<i>It is a woman!</i>"</p>

<p>They could see the figure flung upon the rock, with
a hand clutching at its slippery sides, and Pierre's
breath came in a sudden gasp of despair when he saw
it was a woman. Her face was a ghost's face in the
surf mist, and her drenched hair streamed upon the
rock as the water ebbed away. She seemed to see them
as they stood at the cliff edge, and Pierre thought he
heard her voice rise faintly above the thunder of the
water, crying out for her life.</p>

<p>He turned and ran to a ragged break in the cliff and
climbed down swiftly to the narrow shore line at the
edge of the Finger, shouting for Josette to remain
where she was. But Josette was close behind him when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
he began tearing off his clothes. She was terribly white.
Blood streaked one of her soft cheeks where she had
stumbled against a sharp-edged rock coming down.
But her eyes were filled with a strange and unchanging
fire, and she fell upon her knees among the stones to
unlace one of Pierre's boots while he freed himself of
the other. She looked up at him. A glory of strength
shone in her face even as her heart was breaking in its
agony. For she knew that Pierre Gourdon, her
husband, was going into the pit of death; and she tried
to smile, and Pierre kissed her lips swiftly and sprang
into the sea.</p>

<p>She stood up straight and watched him as he fought
his way through the shore surf toward the seething
maelstrom where the woman lay upon the rock. Josette
could see her clearly. She could see the water and
white spume leaping up about her, reaching for her,
thrusting her up and then dragging her back, and
almost she prayed that God would take her and cover
her completely with the sea so that Pierre might turn
back. For a little her courage left her and she called
wildly upon Pierre to return, telling him she was his
wife and that the woman on the rock was nothing to
him. And then the woman who was fighting for her
life seemed to look into the eyes of Josette through the
distance that separated them&mdash;and Josette held out her
arms and cried encouragement to her.</p>

<p>All sound but the roar of water was lost to Pierre.
He was swimming now, and a hundred forces dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
at his body, beating him one way and then the other,
while with all his strength he fought to keep himself
in the right direction. He knew what it meant to be
carried beyond the rock into that deadly place which
they called the Pit. There he would die. He would be
pulled down by the undertows, and a little later, when
they were done with him, his body would be thrown up
at the foot of the cliff. The thought did not fill him
with fear. It gave him strength to know Josette was
watching him in this struggle against death, and that
she was praying for him&mdash;and for the woman on the
rock.</p>

<p>Only Josette and the other woman could measure the
eternity of time it took him to win the fight. In the
last moment a mighty hand seemed to gather him in its
palm and sweep him up to the rock, and he found himself
clinging to it, facing the woman. She was as white
as he had seen Josette. Her eyes were as dark, and
there was something in them that was more terrible to
look at than fear. Pierre was exhausted. He drew
himself up a few inches at a time, trying to smile the
encouragement he could not speak. His eyes reached
the level of the rock, and he looked over and down&mdash;and
saw then what it was the woman was holding in the
crook of her arm.</p>

<p>It was a little girl, six or seven years old, and forgetting
in his amazement the thundering menace of the
sea Pierre thought that in all his life he had never seen
anything so beautiful as this child. She was not hurt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Her eyes were wide open&mdash;great, dark eyes that were
velvety pools of terror&mdash;and her face, lovely as an
angel's, looked at him from a mass of jet-black hair
that dripped with water and clung about her neck and
shoulders like silken strands of seaweed. It was as if
a vision had crept up from the foaming surf to taunt
him, a vision of a face he had painted in his dreams
and had prayed for and hoped for all through the years
of his life, and he dashed the water from his eyes to see
more clearly. Then he reached down and drew the
child to him and held her fragile, slim little body in his
arms. The woman's face changed then. Its fierce
resolution died out. She became suddenly limp, and
seeing her weakness Pierre caught hold of her so that
the surf would not beat her from the rock.</p>

<p>"I will get you ashore," he shouted. "You must not
give up! You must hold to the rock!"</p>

<p>He bent his face to the child's.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lay against his breast. Her eyes were looking
up at him steadily, and words choked in Pierre's throat.
Those eyes, it seemed to him, were too beautiful for a
child's eyes. Her lips were still red. But her face was
the color of a white cameo in its frame of wonderful
black hair, and the thought came to him again that it
was an angel the storm had blown in from the sea.</p>

<p>The woman was drawing herself up beside him.
Another wave broke against the rock, smothering them
in its surf. Out of it came her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am Mona Guyon," she cried, so close that her head
touched his shoulder. "This is my baby. Her father&mdash;went
down&mdash;there&mdash;beside the rock&mdash;a few minutes
ago. Take her ashore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A roaring flood inundated them. When it was gone
Pierre drew in a deep breath.</p>

<p>"You must hold to the rock," he shouted again. "I
will come back for you. It will be easy&mdash;easy for all of
us to get ashore&mdash;if you will hold to the rock!"</p>

<p>When the roar of the surf died away for a moment
he told the child what to do. She must put her arms
round his neck and ride ashore on his back and draw
in deep breaths whenever her face was out of the water.
They would swim to the shore very quickly, and then
he would come back for mother. He even laughed as
he told her how safely and quickly it could be done.
And then he kissed her; there on the rock Pierre
Gourdon kissed the soft little mouth he had prayed for
so many years, and bowed his head a moment, asking
God to help him. Then he lay flat on his face and drew
her into just the right place on his back, and when her
arms were round his neck he tied her hands tightly
together under his chin with a strip which he had torn
from his shirt. She could not get away after that.
They would go ashore together, one way or the other.</p>

<p>Slowly he lowered himself over the slippery lee of
the rock, and again he smiled at Mona Guyon. The
hour of his Calvary had come, and his heart beat
fiercely with the strength of two praying women as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
slipped into the sea with his precious burden. The
twisting undercurrents reached out like the tentacles of
an octopus and tried to drag him into the doom of the
Pit. But it was not Pierre Gourdon alone who was
fighting for the right to live. The woman on the rock
was fighting for him, and the woman ashore&mdash;standing
to her waist in the boiling surf&mdash;no longer had heart
or soul or strength of body, for all had gone to him;
and about his neck were the arms of a child that gave
to him the courage, not only of those who loved and
prayed, but of the good God who had called upon him
to play his part in this day and hour.</p>

<p>So he fought, and won at last to the place where his
beloved Josette reached out and caught him and helped
him to the stony shore, where he sank down weakly,
with the child in his arms and her face looking up at
him from his breast. He had kept her above the water&mdash;that
had been the never faltering thought in his
mind; and now there seemed to be something of awe,
of reverence, of unspoken worship in those strangely
beautiful eyes of l'Ange, as Pierre called her in his
heart, and suddenly her arms tightened round his neck
and with a little cry she kissed him.</p>

<p>Then she was in Josette's arms, and Pierre rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>A sudden dread swept over him as he looked out at
the rock again. It seemed to him the seas were higher,
and the woman was not as he had left her. Her face
was down, she was limp, a dark blot without life or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
resistance, and he saw a huge wave drive up and move
her like a sodden chip a little nearer to the edge of the
Pit. She was not <i>holding on</i>, as he had prayed God she
would! A few more waves like that last one, a taller
crest, an angrier thrust from the sea&mdash;and she would
go.</p>

<p>He turned to Josette. She was on her knees among
the sharp stones with her arms about the child, and both
she and little Mona were looking up at him, waiting,
knowing that only Pierre Gourdon was master of himself
and of life and death in this hour. He had never
seen such eyes as theirs&mdash;Josette's in their agony of
fear for him, little Mona's so strangely, gloriously
beautiful, saying more to him in their childish terror
and entreaty than human lips could have spoken.</p>

<p>"I am going back," he said. "It will be easy this
time!"</p>

<p>They heard him above the smashing fury of the Pit,
and Pierre, catching an unknown note in his own voice,
knew that he was lying. As he faced the beat of the
sea he made as if he did not hear Josette calling wildly
to him that help would surely come in a few minutes,
and he must wait. A few minutes and it would be over,
for he could see that with each thrust of the frothing
surf over the crest of the rock the woman was a little
nearer to death.</p>

<p>It was a harder fight this time. At least it seemed
so to Pierre, for the old strength was no longer in his
limbs, and something seemed to have gone out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
heart. If he could reach the rock, just reach it and
cling to it and hold the woman until Marie Antoinette's
message brought the men! That was all he prayed for
now, all he hoped for. It was inconceivable for his
imagination to go beyond those things&mdash;the rock, the
woman, a jutting tooth of reef to hang to for their
lives. He could feel death all about him as he fought
and swam. It struck at him, choked him, blinded him,
dragged at his breath until it seemed as if he must give
up and go riding with it into the maelstroms of the
Pit. It laughed and jeered at him and roared in his
ears, but through it all he saw the rock, and at last the
same strange current caught him with the force of a
gargantuan hand and flung him to it.</p>

<p>He tried to climb up, and slipped back. He tried
again and again, and then began to make it, an inch at
a time. Something was singing in his ears. It was
like the droning hum of the saw in the mill. For a
moment he rested. He could not see the top of the
rock, but he could see the shore, and there were many
figures on it now&mdash;men running down to where Josette
was again standing waist-deep in the water.</p>

<p>With new courage he pulled himself up, and then he
gave a cry&mdash;a madman's cry of horror, fear and futile
warning. The woman had slipped to the very edge of
the rock&mdash;the edge that lipped the fury of the Pit. She
was half over. And she was slipping&mdash;<i>slipping</i>....</p>

<p>He scrambled toward her, flinging himself down the
treacherous dip to catch at her long hair. He caught a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
strand of it, but it pulled away from him&mdash;and he
thrust himself another foot and buried his fingers in
the wet mass of it. In that moment the sea took her.
It dragged her down, and Pierre, holding fast to her
hair, went with her into the black death of the Pit; and
as he went his wide eyes saw once more the blue of the
sky and the tops of his beloved forests, and out of his
soul came a soundless cry, the faith and gratitude of a
man who was not afraid to die, "After all&mdash;God has
been a long time good to me&mdash;Pierre Gourdon!"</p>

<p>Even then, in that roaring baptism of death, his mind
was on the woman. It would not do to let her body
beat itself among the rocks alone, and in some way&mdash;as
they were twisted and torn by the rending currents&mdash;he
got his arms about her. He made no effort to fight,
except to hold her. To fight against the forces which
had him in their power was impossible. He was like a
chip in a boiling pot, twisted and turned, now thrust
downward and then up, but never far enough to snatch
a breath of air. He felt the blows of the rocks. Then
he began going down, until it seemed in the last moment
that he was falling swiftly through illimitable space.
Consciousness of the woman's presence was gone, but
he still held her in his arms.</p>

<p>Only the strong hands of Joe Gourdon and Simon
McQuarrie held Josette from joining her husband in
the heart of the Pit. She struggled against them,
crying out her right to go to him, until they brought her
to the narrow rim of beach under the cliff and her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
fell on little Mona. The wind had blown the child's
wet hair back from her face, and a bitter cry came to
Josette's lips and resentment burned in her for an
instant like a fire. Pierre was gone because of <i>her</i>,
because of this beautiful, star-eyed child and the
woman! They had taken him from her. And here
was the child, living, staring at her with those eyes
which had made Pierre call her <i>l'Ange</i>&mdash;staring at her&mdash;while
Pierre&mdash;and the other woman&mdash;dead and
beaten among the rocks.... And then....</p>

<p>"<i>My mother!</i>"</p>

<p>It was the child's voice, two words crying out to her,
faint and yearning and filled with agony above the
lash of the sea, and with an answering cry Josette fell
down sobbing upon her knees and opened her arms and
held the little stranger tightly against her breast. For
a space after that she was blind to what happened about
her. Dominique stood between her and the sea, even as
he saw the grim joke which the fiends of the Pit were
playing upon them this day. For these fiends were
seldom known to give up their playthings, whether logs
or sticks or living things. Once he had known them to
keep the body of a dog for days, and at another time a
strong-limbed buck had died there, and it was a week
before they had tired of him and had thrown him
ashore. But this day there was a change. Joe
Gourdon and Jeremie Poulin and Poleon Dufresne had
leaped waist-deep into the surf and were bringing out
the bodies of Pierre and the woman!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Marie Antoinette who knelt beside them first,
and unclasped Pierre's arms from about the woman.
And then Josette saw them. She staggered to her feet
and ran past Dominique, and the first she looked upon
was the white, dead face of the mother. Very tenderly
then she took Pierre's head in her arms, and bent her
own over it until both their faces were shrouded in her
long hair.</p>

<p>"He isn't dead," she whispered. No one heard her,
for she was saying it only to herself, and then to
Pierre. "He isn't dead. He isn't dead." She repeated
the words, swaying her body gently with Pierre, and
the others drew back, and Marie Antoinette hid little
Mona's face against her while Simon McQuarrie and
Telesphore Clamart bore the dead woman between them
round the end of the cliff. And Josette kept repeating,
"He isn't dead, he isn't dead," and she kissed Pierre's
lips, and pressed her cheek against his cheek, and the
women and men of Five Fingers stood back and waited,
none daring to be first to break in upon these sacred
moments which belonged to Josette and her dead.</p>

<p>At last Marie Antoinette came up softly and knelt
beside Josette and put a loving hand about her shoulder.
Josette's eyes turned to look at her and they were soft
and glowing and so strange they frightened Marie
Antoinette. "He isn't dead," she was still saying, and
she bowed her face down again to Pierre's.</p>

<p>Choking the sob in her throat, Marie Antoinette put
her hand to Josette's face&mdash;and a great shock ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
through her. She had touched Pierre's cheek. She
felt with her other hand, and drew back Josette's hair,
her heart suddenly throbbing like an Indian drum.
Then she saw it was not the madness of grief that kept
Josette repeating those words, but the intuition of a
soul which had felt the nearness of its mate, for
Pierre's eyes slowly opened and the first vision which
came to him out of a roaring sea of dreams was the
face of his wife.</p>

<p>From the group of tensely waiting people Mona had
come, sobbing in a strange, quiet way for her mother,
and as Marie Antoinette drew a little back Josette
caught the child close to her, along with Pierre, and as
Pierre reached his arms up weakly to them both the
thought came to him again, "<i>God has been a long time
good to me&mdash;Pierre Gourdon!</i>"</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the blue jay that mellowed the fear of death
in the swiftly beating heart of Peter McRae. He
had always been a friend of the blue jays, and this
particular bird had perched himself in a spruce top a
hundred feet away, screaming defiance at Peter's
enemies and telling him to keep up his nerve and not
be afraid.</p>

<p>Without going beyond his fourteen-year-old power
of reasoning Peter had a strange and abiding faith in
the Canadian blue jay tribe. He was a boy's bird, if
there ever was one, with his everlasting cocksureness,
his persevering courage and his hundred and one little
tricks of outlawry and piracy&mdash;a bird who was always
ready for a fight, never ran away from trouble, and
who lived up beautifully to the man-made law, "Do
others before others do you." He was a gentleman and
a sportsman even if he was a robber and a pest, and
Peter loved him.</p>

<p>He could see this particular blue jay very clearly.
Shouting voices and the crack of rifles had not
frightened him away, and he was making a great commotion
in the spruce tops, screaming until it seemed his
raucous cries must split his throat. Then, too, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was the cheerful little sapsucker who persisted in pecking
for grubs in the end of the big log behind which
Peter and his father were hidden, and two newly mated
red squirrels who chattered and ran up and down a tree
a little farther on, one chasing the other. A big yellow
butterfly slowly opened and closed its fan-like wings
almost within reach of Peter's hand.</p>

<p>These things kept the madness of utter fear out of
the boy's brain. His thin, rather frail face was very
white; his blue eyes were round, and staring; his body,
not so strong as it should have been, was doubled up
behind the log, and his heart throbbed like a hammer
inside him&mdash;but his courage was not gone. There were
no tear stains about his eyes. In one of his hands he
clutched a twisted stick.</p>

<p>From the blue jay and the sapsucker and the yellow
butterfly his eyes rested upon the face of Donald
McRae, his father. That father, so far back as Peter
could remember clearly, had been not only a father, but
mother and brother and pal as well. "One thing you
must live up to all your life, Peter," this father had told
him a hundred times, "and that is to be a pal to your
own boy when you have one, just as you are now a pal
of your dad's. If a dad and his boy are not pals they
shouldn't have been born." So they had been that,
with no secrets between them except one that had led
up to this tragedy of today, and which the boy had not
yet begun to understand. All he knew was that for
some mysterious reason they were fighting for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
lives, and were now sheltered behind a log, and that
men a little distance away were watching and waiting
to kill them with guns.</p>

<p>The man smiled at him and chuckled in a way Peter
loved. But the smile and the chuckle did not hide the
flame smoldering deep in his eyes, nor the pallid tenseness
of his face, nor the trickle of blood that persisted
in running down his cheek and wetting the soft roll of
his collar. He was bareheaded and sweaty; his blond
hair, very much like Peter's, was wildly disheveled;
his hands gripped a gun, and lying on his stomach,
he had made himself a loophole by digging leaves
and mold from under a crooked elbow in the log.
Through this he had watched for his enemies. His
grin was chummy and companionable as he turned to
Peter.</p>

<p>"Everything all right?" he asked. "Not afraid, are
you?"</p>

<p>Peter shook his head. "I'm not much scared."</p>

<p>"Getting hungry?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Thirsty?"</p>

<p>"A little&mdash;not much."</p>

<p>The man laughed. He did not feel like laughing.
But he laughed, fighting to make it appear natural and
unstrained.</p>

<p>"You're a trump, Peter. God knows you're a
trump!"</p>

<p>A rifle cracked in the thick fringe of balsams and jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
pines a hundred and fifty yards from them, and a bullet
struck the log with a sodden <i>chug</i>. The man wiped
the blood from his cheek with a handkerchief that was
stained red.</p>

<p>"Does it hurt, dad?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a scratch, Peter."</p>

<p>He put his face to the ground and peered under the
log again.</p>

<p>Peter changed his position, uncramped his legs and
doubled himself up in another fashion, hugging the
earth closely. The blue jay was having a fit, and the
sapsucker perked his bright-eyed little head at him not
more than a dozen feet away. He could hear a bird
singing, and one of the red squirrels was chattering his
late afternoon song in a mountain ash tree overhanging
the river. Between his knees was a clump of
violets.</p>

<p>The log was almost at the edge of the river, which
was a swollen flood, and the stream bent itself around
like a hairpin, shutting them in on three sides. That
was why they were safe, Peter's father had told him.
No living thing could swim it to get behind them, and
in front of them was a narrow neck of land which was
open and clear right up to the thick edge of the swamp
a rifle shot away. Across that open no one had dared
to come.</p>

<p>A dozen times during the past hour Peter had wished
the river was not there, for it held them prisoners even
if it did keep their enemies back. Across it, not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
farther away than he could have thrown a stone, was a
deep, dense forest of primeval darkness, low and
swampy, in which he conceived a thousand hiding-places
for himself and his father. Peter's mind sometimes
traveled beyond his years, and as he looked at
the stream, yearning for the safety of the other side,
he wondered why the blue jay and the sapsucker and the
singing brush sparrow should have wings while they
had only legs and arms.</p>

<p>Only wings could carry them over the stream. In
the dry months of summer it was not much more than
a creek, with sand bars and pebbly shores and polished
rocks sticking out of it. Now, in this flood time of
spring, it had no shores and was a thing gone mad. It
was deep and black, and swept past with a steady,
growling roar, eating into the banks on its way, uprooting
trees and slashing itself into caldrons of boiling
fury where the channel narrowed or where it leaped
over the great boulders and rock débris of rapids.
From where he crouched Peter could see one of these
places a quarter of a mile below, and there the water
was not black but white, and leaped and spouted as if
huge monsters were churning it. Under ordinary conditions
the swollen stream would have lured and fascinated
him. It came out of a vast and mysterious
Canadian wilderness, and it disappeared into an adventure
land of forests equally vast and strange. With
it rode many things of interest&mdash;huge piles of driftwood,
shooting down on the crest of the flood like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
islands; big logs that sped with the swiftness of
monster serpents; and great trees, freshly torn out by
the roots, and with their tops trailing and swishing like
whips urging on a living thing.</p>

<p>Peter was staring at it when a hand rested itself
gently on his head. Donald McRae was watching him,
and a slow torture had burned itself like the scar of a
living coal in his eyes and face. More than the earth
he walked upon and more than the God he believed in,
he loved this boy. It was Peter, with his thin, quizzical
face, and his mind and courage developed beyond his
strength and years, who had made life bearable and
joyous for him. As he had worshiped the mother,
linking his soul with hers until it had been taken away,
so he worshiped this one precious part of her she had
left to him. Without Peter....</p>

<p>He choked back the thickness in his throat as he
placed his hand on the boy's head. It was a habit with
him to talk with Peter at times as if he were a man, and
the man-way in which Peter's eyes met his now gave
him courage.</p>

<p>"They won't try to cross that open before dark," he
said. "They're afraid of us in the light, Peter. But
they'll come when it's dark. And we can't wait for
them. We've got to get away."</p>

<p>The boy's face brightened. He had a consummate
faith in this father of his. He waited, keenly expectant,
twisting one of the blue violets between his
thin fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does the creek frighten you, son?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"It's pretty swift, but I'm not much scared of
it."</p>

<p>"Of course not. You wouldn't be your dad's boy, if
you were. See that log down there, the big dry one,
half in the water?" He pointed, and Peter nodded.
"When it begins to get dusk we'll crawl down and take
a ride on that. It won't be hard to get away."</p>

<p>For the first time a tremor came in the boy's voice.</p>

<p>"Dad, what are they trying to shoot us for? What
have we done?"</p>

<p>Donald McRae made a pretense of peering through
his loophole again. He wanted to cry out with the
sickness that was in his heart, and in the same voice call
down the vengeance of God upon the makers of that
grim and merciless law which at last had come to corner
and destroy him where he had built his little cabin
home in the edge of the wilderness. It was impossible&mdash;now&mdash;to
answer that question of Peter's, "<i>What
have we done?</i>"</p>

<p>He raised his head, and faced his boy.</p>

<p>"It's five o'clock. We'd better have a bite to eat.
When we take to the water it will spoil our grub."</p>

<p>From the pocket of a coat which lay at his side he
took some biscuits and meat. Peter made a sandwich
and munched at it, yearning for a little of the black
river-water to go with it. When the man had finished
he drew from an inside pocket of the same coat a
wallet, a pencil and a corked bottle half filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
matches. In the wallet he found a sheet of paper, and
on this he wrote for several minutes, after which he
folded the sheet of paper very tightly, thrust it into
the bottle with the matches, and corked it in securely.
Then he gave the bottle to Peter.</p>

<p>"Put that in your pocket," he said, "and remember
what I'm telling you now, Peter. We're going to make
for a place called Five Fingers. A man lives there
whose name is Simon McQuarrie. Don't forget those
two&mdash;Five Fingers and Simon McQuarrie. What I
have written and put in the bottle is for him. If anything
should happen to me&mdash;&mdash;" He broke in upon
himself with a cheerful laugh. "Of course nothing
<i>will</i> happen, Peter, but if it should&mdash;you promise to
take that bottle to him?"</p>

<p>"I'll take it."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Five Fingers."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Simon McQuarrie."</p>

<p>"Right. Now keep watch through this hole while I
cut some leather strings out of the tops of my boots.
We may need them to harness the log with when we
go to sea. Won't they be surprised when they come
and find us gone&mdash;eh&mdash;Peter?"</p>

<p>"You bet they will!" agreed Peter fervently.</p>

<p>Quietly he began watching the open through the hole
which his father had made under the log. He breathed
a little more tensely, for he realized the deadly importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of his vigil. Yesterday one of his ambitions had
been to wear a uniform when he was old enough, one
with stripes and brass buttons, and with a big revolver
fastened to a cord hung around his neck. He had
looked upon the wilderness police with the awe of a
youngster who loved romance and adventure. Today
he hated them. Only a little while ago he had waited
for his father at their cabin, with a good dinner ready
for him. Then his father had come, galloping on a
horse Peter had never seen before.</p>

<p>"I've had a little trouble with the police, Peter, and
we've got to hit into the woods," he had said.</p>

<p>The suddenness of it had taken Peter's breath away.
They did not wait to eat any of the dinner he had prepared.
Even then the police almost caught them before
they reached this log. There were four of them. His
father had kept them back with his rifle, and Peter was
disappointed in his marksmanship. He was sure he
could have done better himself. His father missed every
time, even though his bullets did go close enough to
make their enemies dodge behind trees. And always before
that he had been proud of his father's
shooting!</p>

<p>His hand touched the cool barrel of the rifle, and a
thrill ran through him. It was a thing he had never
felt before. He was sure <i>he</i> would not miss if he could
only be given a chance, for he had often hit rabbits at
that distance of a hundred and fifty yards, and a man
was many times larger than a rabbit. An inch at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
time, slowly and carefully so that his father would not
notice what he was doing, he poked the barrel of the
rifle through the hole. He would be ready, anyway.
He had forgotten fear. His blood was hot. His
father had always talked to him about playing square,
and never taking a mean advantage, and always to fight
for women, no matter who they were. Well, there
were no women here, but it wasn't playing square when
four men came after his father like this. If they would
come out, clean and sportsmanlike, one at a time, and
fight with fists instead of guns....</p>

<p>"You see, Peter," his father was saying as he cut a
thin strip from his boot top, "I couldn't leave you in
the cabin alone. I've got to get you down to Five
Fingers. If Simon McQuarrie isn't there, you wait for
him. And don't show anyone else that paper in the
bottle!"</p>

<p>Peter was not listening. His heart had given a
sudden terrific jump and was half choking him. In the
edge of a clump of dwarf banksians something had
moved. And then his father turned&mdash;just in time to
catch his hand, to stop his finger at the trigger, to drag
him back from the hole. Never as long as he lived
would he forget the terrible look that had come into his
father's face. To hide it Donald McRae leaned over his
son and hugged him close to his arms, and for a space
the law might have descended upon them without
resistance.</p>

<p>From the shelter of the evergreens Corporal Crear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the Provincial Police was looking toward the log.
His men were lying close about him.</p>

<p>"We've got to go out and get him when it's dark
enough," he said. "Don't shoot unless you have to, but
if that happens&mdash;shoot straight. Only be sure it's not
the kid. That's what puzzles me&mdash;why McRae has the
kid with him out there behind the log!"</p>

<p>Only Donald McRae and Peter could have solved
that mystery for Crear, and even then Crear might not
have understood. It was something which belonged
entirely to Peter and his father. As they waited for
the sun to dip behind the tall evergreen forest across the
river, they lay very close together, and their eyes met
frequently and their hands and bodies touched.</p>

<p>There was something pathetically doglike in the
man's dependence upon his boy. Take Peter away
from him and his heart was gone, for Peter was the one
thing he had left of a great faith and a great love that
would never die. More than once a cold fear had swept
over him at the thought of something happening to
him, and he had always prayed that if anything did
happen, it would come to both at the same time. Even
now he would not have sent Peter back to the safety of
the cabin. That would have meant dissolution for
himself&mdash;and strangers and a heartbreaking tragedy of
aloneness for Peter.</p>

<p>Across the river there was hope, and a refuge for
Peter at Five Fingers with Simon McQuarrie. A
woman had put an undying faith in the justness of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in Donald McRae's soul, and always there were two
things in his breast, faith and memory of the woman,
like stars which no darkness could dim. Their glow
lay warmly in his eyes as he saw the courage with
which the boy waited for the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>As the long shadows came creeping across the river
Peter no longer felt the fear which had made his heart
beat so uncomfortably fast. His father's presence and
the touch of his hand filled him with an utter confidence.
The man even pointed out to him the mysteries
of an ant home which they had accidentally destroyed
in the log, and told him a story of how once upon a time
he had gone down a flooded stream like this, and what
fun it had been.</p>

<p>Then the shadows came more swiftly. The sun at
last left only a golden glow above the forest. The blue
jay and the sapsucker were gone. Out of the woods
came the melodious dusk song of many red squirrels.
A flock of crows sailed overhead on their way to the
evening roosting place. The rush of the river seemed
more gentle and lost its menace for Peter. The churning
turmoil of the distant rapids was mellowed in a
soft mist, and a little later they could not make out
clearly the driftwood going down with the stream.</p>

<p>"Now is our time," said Peter's father. "Creep
after me, flat on your stomach."</p>

<p>It took them only a minute to reach the big dry log.
They could move freely here, for the upward dip of
the bank concealed them. Donald McRae did not let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Peter guess the tension he was under as he worked. He
stood his rifle where the police would easily find it and
laughed softly as he tied one end of a stout leather
thong about Peter's wrist and the other end about his
own. After that he rolled the log into the water and
tested it to get its proper balance and tied the other
leather thongs to a projecting stub.</p>

<p>"It's just right," he announced cheerfully. "A canoe
couldn't have been better built for us, Peter. Are you
ready?"</p>

<p>"I'm ready," said Peter.</p>

<p>He was in the water to his knees; now he went in to
his waist. It was cold, biting cold; his teeth clicked, but
he did not say anything about it. He looped his arms
about the stub and through one of the leather thongs,
and from the opposite side of the log his father twisted
the fingers of one hand tightly in his coat. Then they
began to move. His feet lost bottom and the cold
water shot up to his armpits, taking his breath away.
His father grinned cheerfully at him and he tried to
grin back. In a moment they were in the current and
the shore began to slip past them with amazing swiftness.
It was not unpleasant, except for the icy chill of
the water, which seemed to take the place of blood in
his veins. There was no resistance against his
body; the log carried them buoyantly and smoothly,
so that after a little he had courage to look about
him.</p>

<p>Their log had swung quickly into mid-stream, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
they were overtaking a more slowly moving mass of
driftwood. The thought came to Peter that it was like
a race. Then something alive caught his eyes on the
flotsam. It was a furry, catlike creature with short,
perky ears and a fox's face, and he could almost have
touched it with his hands when they passed.</p>

<p>"A fisher-cat," said his father. "He will have a nice
swim when he hits the rapids!"</p>

<p>Peter was wondering just how much of a chance the
fisher-cat had when something drifted against him. It
was a drowned porcupine, floating belly up. The porky
must have had a nice swim, too!</p>

<p>He shivered. The roar of the rapids was growing,
and it was no longer pleasant to hear. The musical
cadence which distance had given it was gone, and a
sullen, snarling undertone of menace and wrath began
to pound at the drums of his ears. In the twilight it
looked as though they were racing straight into the
mouth of a huge churn out of which milky froth was
spouting.</p>

<p>Then two things happened which seemed odd to
Peter. The dead porcupine was clinging to the log as
if some sort of life held it there, and the fisher-cat's raft
of driftwood which they had overtaken and passed was
now <i>passing them</i>. To Peter this last was unaccountable,
but to Donald McRae, who understood the whims
and caprices of flood currents, there was no mystery
about it. For a moment the fisher-cat seemed about to
make a leap for the log. Then he huddled back and disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with his raft in the rougher water that preceded
the gray wall of spume.</p>

<p>The man's hand tightened its hold on Peter.</p>

<p>"Hang on and don't get scared," he cried. "We'll go
through this like a rubber ball!"</p>

<p>That was the last Peter heard of his voice, and suddenly
his father's face was blotted out from his vision.
A huge mouth opened and engulfed them. He could
feel himself going down it, with roaring gloom and
mighty explosions of water bursting itself against
great rocks all about him. For a space which seemed
an eternity he gave himself up for lost, and he wanted
to scream out to his father. But the water smothered
him. It thrust him under, buried him, then tossed him
up to breathe. He hung on, as his father had told him,
and after three or four minutes which were so many
hours to him he could breathe easier and the roaring
grew less.</p>

<p>They had come through a half-mile of the rapids
then. The last of the rocks snapped at them, like
growling dogs at their heels, and suddenly the water
grew deep and smooth where it swung shoreward in a
great eddy. For the first time Peter felt a hurt. It
was his father's hand, holding him in a grip that only
death could have broken. And then he saw his father's
face. Donald McRae was gasping for breath. Even
Peter would never know the fight he had made to keep
the log running right during those three or four minutes
in the rapids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly the current brought them to the shore. It
was the shore they wanted, too, with its deep evergreen
forests and its hundreds of miles of untrailed hiding-places.
The big pool was dotted with drifting masses
of débris. One of these, very near to them, Peter was
sure he recognized. But the fisher-cat was no longer
on it.</p>

<p>He was terribly cold, and when at last his father
brought the end of the log to the shore and helped him
out to dry ground the boy fell down in a sodden heap.
He was ashamed of himself and tried to get up.</p>

<p>Donald McRae took one of his hands.</p>

<p>"You must walk, Peter&mdash;run if you can. Come on!"</p>

<p>He almost dragged him into the darkness of the
forest, and Peter began to use his legs. It made him
feel better. But his teeth chattered and his body shook
as if he had the ague. Two or three hundred yards in
the shelter of the timber they came to an overturned
spruce tree, and near this was a birch with festoons of
loose bark hanging from it.</p>

<p>Donald McRae stripped off an armful of the bark,
and one of Peter's blue hands fished out the precious
bottle of matches from his pocket. Very soon the
flames were leaping up joyously, and he felt their
warmth entering into his body. He helped to gather
wood. In a quarter of an hour there was a glow in his
face, and the big backlog of pitch-filled cedar was a
flaming furnace. Darkness settled heavily in the
forest, and he was no longer afraid or uncomfortable as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
he continued to dry his clothes. His father, in a period
between wood-gathering, cleaned his pipe and began to
dry out some of his soaked tobacco. That was cheerful
and inspiring. It always seemed chummier and more
homelike to Peter when his father was smoking his
pipe.</p>

<p>Later they broke off cedar and balsam boughs until
they had a soft bed two feet deep within the warmth of
the fire. When the last thread in his clothing was dry
Peter crept into this bed. He had no idea of sleeping
but made himself a comfortable nest and sat bright-eyed
and watchful while his father rested with his back
against the log and smoked.</p>

<p>A hundred times they had made camps together that
were very much like this one. On hunting and fishing
expeditions, and when berries were ripe, and on the
trap lines, they had slept out many nights with boughs
for a bed. But there had never been the thrill of tonight.
The cumulative significance of what had happened
was just beginning to find itself in Peter's head.
This night was different from all other nights. The
darkness which had gathered heavily about them was
different, the fire did not seem as friendly, and his
father, smoking his pipe, was changed. Always in their
adventuring they had been in quest of something&mdash;fish
or venison, berries or fur. Now something was after
them. It was this slow process of mental and physical
change from the hunter into the hunted, and its understanding,
that was creeping into Peter's soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>He loved night with its mystery of darkness, its
stars and its moon, but now he could feel and hear it
breathing secret plottings and danger. When the fire
crackled too loudly or its flames leaped too high he
shivered, fearing it would betray them. He wondered
why his father remained in the light now that they
were warm and dry, for there were safer hiding-places
in the great pits of gloom that encompassed them. But
he said nothing, feeling strangely that even to voice
fear would bring reality upon them.</p>

<p>He watched his father, and the brightness in his
eyes&mdash;something new and strange that lay in them&mdash;was
like a stab to Donald McRae. In this hour he saw
the boy's soul changing. Peter, at last, was beginning
to build up the truth. Something terrible must have
happened&mdash;somewhere&mdash;or the police would not be
after his father. He had believed the police were
omniscient, that they hunted only bad people. That
was what they were for&mdash;to shut bad people in prisons,
or hang them, or shoot them. <i>And they were after his
father!</i></p>

<p>The man saw these things in Peter's eyes and in his
pale, thin face. And suddenly a revulsion of horror
and of rage swept over Peter. If the police said his
father was bad they were liars. He hated them, and if
the chance came to him he would get even with them.
He would beat out their lives with a club. He would
kill them&mdash;if they didn't leave his father alone!</p>

<p>He said nothing. But he got out of his nest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
evergreen boughs and sat close to his father against the
log, and Donald McRae put his arm around him and
puffed hard at his pipe to keep the firelight from revealing
what was in his eyes. The world might be against
him, but Peter would be like this, his friend and pal
to the last. He knew it, and thanked God.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> did not know when he fell asleep. He was
buried in the sweet-scented cedar and balsam
when his father awakened him. He sat up and rubbed
his eyes, and it came to him quickly where he was. The
fire was out and dawn was breaking up the gloom of
the forest. He missed the fire, and the bacon frying
over it, and the pot of coffee steaming in the coals.
Those were the usual things that greeted him when he
woke up in camp. And this morning he was hungry.</p>

<p>They headed straight into the heart of the unexplored
timberlands south and west, and with empty
hands and no pack on his back Donald McRae talked as
cheerfully as though they had a week's rations with
them. But his eyes were constantly questing for something
to eat, and it occurred to him as a sort of tragedy
that he had not tied his rifle to the log. He did not
explain to Peter just why he had left it where the police
would easily find it.</p>

<p>By midday their hunt for food had become a thrilling
adventure to Peter. It stirred his blood even more
than thought of their enemies, for the police seemed an
interminable distance away now, shut out by miles of
wilderness. There was something fascinating about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
too. There were birds about them and rabbit runways
in every dip and swamp they came to, and deer and
moose and caribou tracks so plentiful in places that
they made trails like the hoof-beaten paths of cattle.</p>

<p>But there was nothing they could get at, except porcupines.
During the morning they could have killed
half a dozen of these animals with clubs, but each time
porcupine flesh was suggested for dinner Peter made a
grimace of revulsion. Twice they had tried it experimentally
on their camping trips and both times it had
nauseated him. He insisted he would rather starve
than eat any more of that ill-smelling, fatty stuff the
porcupine was made of. He would chew spruce gum
instead. There was plenty of it on the trees they
passed.</p>

<p>"If you get too hungry we'll roast some lily roots,"
said Donald, "but if you can hold out until night we'll
have the feast of our lives."</p>

<p>Peter held out. The sun was still up when they came
from heavy timber into a long, narrow meadow running
into a swamp on the other side. This was the sort
of place Donald McRae had been looking for. In the
edge of the swamp were rabbit runways beaten fresh
and hard. They chose the site for their camp in the
rim of the high timber, and while Peter brought in firewood
Donald made snares from another section of
boot top. These he set in the runways. It was scarcely
more than dusk when the first big snowshoe ran his
head through a noose and found himself swinging at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the end of a sapling. An hour later he was roasted,
and in the light of their fire they divided the feast between
them. Peter didn't mind the absence of salt and
bread and potatoes. Nothing he could remember had
ever tasted quite so good to him as the unseasoned rabbit.</p>

<p>Food and the warmth of the fire made him drowsy,
and very soon after they had finished their supper
Donald tucked him snugly into the bed of evergreens
they had made and covered him with his coat. Peter
fell asleep instantly, and for several minutes the man
remained on his knees at his side, the smile of tenderness
in his face changing slowly into a look of haggard
grief. When he rose to his feet the luster had died out
of his eyes and years had fallen upon his shoulders.
He caught his breath sobbingly as he stared into the
wall of chaotic darkness beyond the firelight. It was
only Peter who counted now, and this night was the
last Peter would be with him. Tomorrow he would be
alone, an outlaw, a hunted man running away to save
his life. And Peter....</p>

<p>A moan came to his lips, a dry and broken cry of
hopelessness, and his eyes fixed themselves in their
anguish upon the heart of the fire. Without Peter,
would God give him strength to live? What would the
days be like&mdash;and the nights&mdash;and the months and years
to come without Peter? For Peter was not only
Peter. In taking the mother, God had given her soul
back to him in the body of her boy. She was a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
him, speaking with his voice, looking out of his eyes,
loving with his love, a comrade and pal to the man in
spirit even as she had been in her own sweet life. And
now&mdash;tomorrow&mdash;he would lose them both. The
law was after him. Its hounds would follow him from
hole to hole, like foxes after a rabbit, and probably in
the end they would get him.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes to shut out the thing that was
hurting him. When he opened them a face seemed to
have taken form in the glow of the fire like a soul come
to give him courage and resolution, sweetly sad in its
inspiration, glorious in its consolation and cheer.
Every day through the years this visioning of his wife
had come to him; through those years she had walked
hand in hand with him, she had been with him in the
upgrowing of Peter, had helped to teach him the love of
God and the glory of nature, and had laughed and cried
and sung with them as sunshine and shadow came.
And always, in the darkest hours, Donald McRae saw
her face, sweet and strong and never afraid. And so
it was tonight.</p>

<p>"This is your last great fight for our Peter," her
eyes seemed to say to him. "You must be strong."</p>

<p>And then she was gone. Slowly the fire died out,
and he put no more wood upon it, but sat motionless
and silent until it was only a red glow of ember and
ash.</p>

<p>He did not sleep. The moon rose and the clear sky
above was filled with stars. In their light he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
back and forth in the open, a solitary figure with a
thousand still shadows about him. It was the sort of
night he loved, a spring night breathing and whispering
of summer and sweet with the perfumes of balsam and
spruce and growing things under his feet. These
things were a part of his God, and of Peter's God.
Just as the woman had built up his faith in him, pointing
out its truth and beauty and glory, so had he built
up in Peter an illimitable faith in this God which was
nature. It strengthened him now. The glow of the
moon, the softness of the stars, the gentle whisperings
of the wind, the low music of running water and the
thrill and tremble of inanimate and voiceless life about
him were a part of his religion.</p>

<p>"Love a tree and you love God," had been his text
for Peter. And as long as there remained trees and
flowers and the songs of birds and eyes and ears with
which to see and hear, hope could never die. His brain
cleared and his heart grew stronger as he paced more
swiftly through the moonlight. The world was gloriously
big, he told himself again and again. Somewhere
in it was a place for him and Peter, and when he found
it, far away from the menace of the law, Peter would
not fail to come when he called. But tomorrow he
must be strong enough to lie and strong enough to leave
Peter at Five Fingers with Simon McQuarrie.</p>

<p>Toward dawn he built up the fire and cooked another
rabbit which he caught in one of the snares. It was
ready when Peter crawled out of his balsam bed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
did not know his father had not slept during the night.
Donald McRae began to whistle when he saw the boy
was awake, and though an uncomfortable thickening,
persisted in his throat he fought to make the whistling
cheerful just the same.</p>

<p>He announced his plan to Peter as if it were born of
sudden inspiration and happily solved a temporary
problem for them. He told him about Five Fingers
and their old friend, Simon McQuarrie. Peter could
just remember the Scotchman and Simon's fat Dutch
partner and friend, Herman Vogelaar. Donald McRae
seemed to recall them now with great pleasure, and he
was sure Peter would enjoy his little visit with them,
especially as there were several boys and girls of his
own age to play with at Five Fingers. Of course he
would come back soon, and maybe they would live at
Five Fingers, if Peter liked it there. He continued to
build up the lie, but something of trouble remained deep
back in the boy's eyes. Donald tried not to see it too
much, for it was the look he would have seen in the
woman's eyes, if she had been in Peter's place.</p>

<p>They traveled until noon and ate their lunch. The
afternoon was well gone when they heard the striking
of an axe ahead of them. A quarter of an hour later
they could hear several axes, and the distant crash of
a falling tree. Donald McRae steeled his heart, and
stopped. Yet in this moment he was smiling.</p>

<p>"That is Five Fingers," he said. "Can you go on
alone, Peter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter nodded. "But I don't want to," he said. "I
want to go with you, dad."</p>

<p>"You must go to Five Fingers, Peter. I'll come back
soon. I promise that. I'll come back&mdash;soon."</p>

<p>A gulp came in Peter's throat.</p>

<p>"I'm not tired. I can go a long ways yet, dad. I'd
rather go with you."</p>

<p>The man drew him into his arms.</p>

<p>"I'll come back tomorrow," he lied, fighting to speak
the words calmly. "And you must get the paper in the
bottle to Simon McQuarrie as soon as you can. You
aren't afraid to go alone, are you, Peter?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you must go." He hugged him close for a
moment, and rested his cheek on Peter's disheveled
hair. "Maybe I'll come back tonight," he whispered
desperately. "Good-by, little pal. Hurry&mdash;and give
Simon the paper&mdash;and&mdash;good-by!"</p>

<p>His lips burned against Peter's forehead. It was
that kiss which startled Peter, and when his father
turned away, and then looked back, smiling and waving
a hand, a suffocating feeling remained in Peter's heart
as if he could not get all the air he wanted to breathe.
He tried to wave his hand in response, but in a moment
it fell limply to his side. Donald McRae saw the
gesture and a sob came in his breath. He disappeared
behind a windfall, stopped and looked back. Peter
was slowly turning toward Five Fingers. The small
figure was pathetic in its aloneness. Twice it paused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and turned, and then went on, and was hidden at last
by a screen of evergreens.</p>

<p>"God be with you and care for you, Peter, and give
me strength to bear this parting," sobbed Donald
McRae.</p>

<p>With white and haggard face he turned into the
North.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>





<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> the thicket of young jack pines Peter
did not hurry. His feet dragged, and he listened,
hoping he would hear his father's voice calling him
back. In half an hour he did not travel far beyond the
evergreens. Then he knew his father was gone. He
continued in the direction of Five Fingers, recalling
his promises. Tonight or tomorrow his father would
return. He hoped it would be tonight, for there was a
lump in his throat which he could not get rid of, and
something in his heart which frightened him with
suspicions and fears which he was too young to analyze.
But he knew his father would not lie. He would come
back. He wondered what was written on the paper he
was taking to Simon McQuarrie. Probably it told
about the wickedness of the police, and Simon would
help in some way. Other questions came into his mind
now that he was alone. Why hadn't his father gone
on to Five Fingers with him?</p>

<p>The chopping of the axes had ceased, but he knew he
was heading in the right direction. He came into
openings filled with the stumps of trees that had been
cut down, and these clearings were carpeted with white
and pink spring flowers and masses of violets. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
never seen such beautiful violets, or so many birds at
this season of the year. There were robins and
thrushes and dozens of little warblers and brush sparrows,
and the cutting down of trees seemed to have
brought all the sapsuckers and woodpeckers and gaudily
colored blue jays in the woods. The sun was delightfully
warm, too, though in another hour it would be
settling behind the tree tops. In this glory of peace and
quiet he proceeded quietly and cautiously, for his father
had taught him always to do that in the forest. So he
came without sound of footfall or crackling brush to
the edge of a little opening beyond a thicket of poplars
and birch, and here he stopped suddenly and his heart
jumped up into his mouth.</p>

<p>Standing in a warm pool of sunlight not twenty feet
away from his concealment was a young girl. She was
almost as tall as Peter and so lovely to look upon that
he stared at her in amazement and admiration. He
thought she had seen him, and his first vision was of
her face and a pair of beautiful dark eyes, laughing up
at a red squirrel, chattering in a tree top a few paces
away. Then she sat down, gathering her flowers about
her, and eyes and face were lost to him in a mass
of shining, black hair that fell quickly about
her, almost touching the ground she was seated
upon.</p>

<p>At first he was astonished. Then timidity and fear
crept upon him and he wanted to steal away as quietly
as he had come. He drew back a step and was preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
for the next when an unexpected interruption
rooted him to the spot. The wild and agonized yelping
of a dog came from the thick brush beyond the girl.
Instantly she was on her feet, her slim body quivering
with the tension in which she waited. And then she
called, "Buddy&mdash;Buddy&mdash;come here!"</p>

<p>With a series of pain-filled yelps the creature called
Buddy responded. He darted out of the brush and
came like a streak across the open. It seemed to Peter
the half-grown pup was all legs and head and tail, and
that from the sounds he made he must be mortally
hurt. Whimpering and crying, he cringed at the girl's
feet and kissed the hand she reached down to him. But
she did not look at him. She had dropped her
flowers and her attitude was fierce and expectant as she
waited.</p>

<p>Peter could see the bushes moving across the open
and in a moment a boy burst through them. He was
half again as big as Peter, and he had a stick in his
hand. He followed the dog, half running, and Peter
began to hate him as he came. "Any person who will
strike a dog should never have been born," his father
had taught him from the beginning; and this boy with
his thick red face and hulking body had been beating
the pup. He was panting triumph when he came up,
and the pup slunk closer between the feet of his mistress.
The pursuer was at least two years older than
Peter. He had thick hands and little eyes and a bullet
head, and his eyes were glowing with wickedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>For an instant Peter saw the girl's eyes. They were
dark pools of flaming fire. Then like a little tigress she
was at the other. Her hands struck at his face and for
a moment the bully was caught at a disadvantage. He
dropped his stick and caught her in his arms. His
hands buried themselves in her hair, and Peter saw her
blows becoming more and more futile. The pup
snarled and darted in at the boy's feet. A kick sent
him back howling.</p>

<p>Horror and rage possessed Peter when he saw the
girl's head thrust backward, and without a sound he ran
out of his cover and caught her assailant by the throat.
Then, when the girl was freed, he struck. That was
another thing his father had taught him, to fight when
it was necessary to fight&mdash;<i>and always for a woman</i>.
His fists struck hard and furiously, and he heard a bellow
of alarm and pain from the bully.</p>

<p>The older boy stumbled and fell, and Peter was
on him like a cat. He realized this was no time to
"play the game fair." They rolled and twisted on the
ground, and blood streamed from the bully's nose and
mouth. Once Peter saw the girl. She was standing
very near, her lips parted, her wonderful eyes
shining at him. That glimpse of her was a mighty
encouragement. He fought harder, driving his fists
home, and kicking. Then they were on their feet
again.</p>

<p>It was the bully who renewed the battle. Mauled
and bleeding, he had recovered from the surprise attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and his greater bulk and weight began to tell.
Exhausted by two days and nights of hunger and
flight, Peter felt his strength going. He went down,
and the bully flung himself upon him. It was then
Peter caught a second glimpse of the girl. She had
caught up the stick and was standing over them. He
could hear the stick as it struck blow after blow, and his
enemy rolled over, half stunned. They were both at
the bully then, Peter with his fists and the girl with
her stick, and the older boy took to his heels in a wild
flight for the safety of the thicket out of which he had
come a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Peter wiped his nose and mouth with his sleeve and
gasped hard to get his breath. The girl was breathing
hard, too, and she was looking at him with such
wonder and gladness in her eyes that he wished he
was back in the timber again. Then she came to him
and began nursing his face with a soft handkerchief,
and said things which he could not remember
afterward, and Buddy the pup jumped up against
him, wagging his knotty tail and licking his
hand.</p>

<p>Peter drew back and tried to grin. For a moment
he had felt enormously uncomfortable in the presence
of this lovely little goddess of the woods, with her soft
handkerchief dabbing at his face. Now his old cheer
returned. He was glad the fight was over and was
strongly conscious that the girl had played no small
part in the final victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>So he said apologetically, "He'd got me if you hadn't
come in with the stick."</p>

<p>She stood back and looked at him. She was younger
than he, probably not more than thirteen, but to Peter
she appeared to be infinitely older in these first minutes
of their acquaintance. It bothered him to meet her eyes
squarely, they were so big and dark and filled with soft
fire, like the velvety, jet-black hair that streamed in
dishevelment about her.</p>

<p>"He is twice as big as you," she retorted. "I hate
him. He belongs with the tug from Fort William, and
every time he comes we have a fight."</p>

<p>"He's a&mdash;a woman-hitter," said Peter.</p>

<p>She accepted his compliment with a dignified nod
of her head. Then she stamped her foot and shook
her stick in the direction the bully had gone.
"If he ever tries to do again what he tried today&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He won't while I'm around," helped out Peter,
swelling with a bit of pugnacious pride. "I wasn't in
good shape, and I've been traveling pretty hard, and
we didn't have a lot to eat. I can lick him when I'm
fed up and rested."</p>

<p>The girl was almost womanly in her swift intuition.
Her eyes glowed softly at Peter.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked gently. "I am Mona
Guyon, and I live with Josette and Pierre Gourdon at
Five Fingers."</p>

<p>"I'm Peter," said the boy. "Peter McRae."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where you from?" was her next query.</p>

<p>Peter took time to swallow. His father had not told
him how to answer questions. Then he pointed.</p>

<p>"From away off there, miles and miles. My father
brought me until we could hear the axes, and then I
came on alone. He's coming tonight or tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Is your mother with him?"</p>

<p>"She's dead."</p>

<p>He was not looking at her when she came to him
and took his hand, and in all his life he had never felt
such a warm, soft little hand clinging to his own as
Mona Guyon's.</p>

<p>"My mother is dead, too, Peter," she said. "And so
is my father. They were drowned&mdash;out there six years
ago. It was Pierre Gourdon who brought me in from
the rock."</p>

<p>It was an uncomfortable moment, and yet something
of joy passed into Peter. His fingers, smoke-stained
and soiled, tightened about Mona's hand as they both
looked off over the cuttings to the wall of the vast
forest that shut out Lake Superior from their view.
They could plainly hear the distant murmuring of
the surf.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come," she said. "I hope you're
going to live here. Are you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Peter.</p>

<p>"You're brave, and I like you. If you were that
hateful Aleck Curry, who looks like a toad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be him," interrupted Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but if you <i>were</i>, and you tried to do what he
did, I wouldn't hit you with a stick."</p>

<p>Peter's mind floundered in a futile effort to understand.</p>

<p>"I can lick him tomorrow," he ventured.</p>

<p>With a little laugh she pulled him to the scattered
flowers. He helped her pick them up and put them into
one big bouquet. Her soft hair touched his hands and
he found it easier to look into her eyes. His heart beat
fast and he was strangely happy. He forgot his swelling
eye and a stiffening lip, but he did think of his
father. He would surely beg his father to live at Five
Fingers. It would be wonderful there, with someone
like Mona to know and fight for.</p>

<p>Then he thought of his message.</p>

<p>"I've got something for Simon McQuarrie," he said.
"Dad told me to hurry with it."</p>

<p>"And you're hungry."</p>

<p>She took his hand again, in a possessive and matter-of-fact
way. There was something maternal about it,
something so sweetly glad and friendly that a great
wave of comradeship swept through Peter. He was no
longer nervous or afraid. Tonight or tomorrow his
father would come, and they would all be happy.</p>

<p>Through a glory of warm sunset they crossed the
cut-over opens and came soon to the crest of the green
slope that looked down on a little paradise hidden away
in the heart of a great wilderness, a paradise of green
meadows, of water shimmering like silver in the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and of the few log homes wherein lived the people
whose paths Pierre Gourdon had blazed through the
forests many years before.</p>

<p>"That is Five Fingers," said Mona.</p>

<p>And down the slope she led the way with Peter, still
holding him by the hand.</p>

<p>He was speechless as they went. Everywhere he
looked the earth was gloriously green, and in this green
were the scattered cabins, with little spirals of smoke
rising from their chimneys. He could smell this
smoke, faintly sweet with the perfume of jack pine
pitch and cedar. He saw the big, yellow dunes of sawdust
about the mill, and in the mill itself, which had
only a roof and no sides, the huge steel saw that was
silent for the day blazed like a mirror in the sun. The
lowing of cattle came up from the green meadows, and
he saw horses grazing, and then his heart gave another
jump, for between them and the little plain where the
settlement lay were a doe and fawn. His fingers tightened
suddenly about Mona's hand, and he stopped, an
excited wonder escaping in a cry from his lips. The girl
laughed softly and freed her hand for a moment to
braid back her lustrous hair.</p>

<p>"That is Minna," she said. "We named her after
Geertruda Poulin's last baby. Pierre Gourdon allows
no killing for miles and miles around here, and the deer
feed out of our hands and eat our hay with the cattle in
winter. Only&mdash;&mdash;" Her lovely face clouded, and
Peter saw a glow of distress in her eyes. "The men kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
porcupines because they eat our chairs and doors and
windows. But they bury them for me, over there in my
porcupine cemetery, and I plant flowers all around
them. I love porcupines."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Peter.</p>

<p>She took his hand again, and they continued down
the slope. "Uncle Pierre lets me have three of them for
pets," she said. "I have a great many pets, hundreds
of them. All the birds and deer and bears and wild
things for as far as you can see belong to me, and none
of them are afraid of me. Uncle Pierre gave them to
me, and no one harms them. No one except Aleck
Curry," she added with a quick note of fierceness rising
in her voice. "He would kill them all if he dared. I
hate him!"</p>

<p>"I'll lick him if he doesn't leave them alone," offered
Peter. "I can do it when I'm fed up."</p>

<p>She squeezed his hand.</p>

<p>"That's their boat&mdash;down there&mdash;with the big scow.
It comes from Fort William four or five times each
spring and summer to take the lumber away. Aleck's
father owns it, and I hate him, too. He laughs at
Uncle Pierre and wants to bring hunters up."</p>

<p>Peter was silent. A miracle was unfolding itself in
his soul and under his eyes. As they came near to the
first of the cabins he thought again of his father and his
message.</p>

<p>"Where does Simon McQuarrie live?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girl pointed to a little cabin near the mill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
"Over there. And that's where I live&mdash;in the first of
those two big cabins with the rows of white stones
around them. Uncle Pierre and Aunt Josette live
there, and Marie Antoinette and Joe in the other. Joe
is Uncle Pierre's boy, and Marie Antoinette is his wife.
You'll love them. Everybody does&mdash;except Aleck
Curry."</p>

<p>"I smell bacon," suggested Peter.</p>

<p>The girl sniffed.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's from Simon McQuarrie's cabin," she
announced, a little disappointed. "Won't you come
down to our place? Please!"</p>

<p>"I've got to see Simon," persisted Peter. "My father
told me to see him first."</p>

<p>Simon saw them coming. His hard Scotch face
softened as he saw Mona, and he scarcely noticed Peter
until they were at his open door. Then Mona said,
releasing her proprietary hold on the boy's hand: "This
is Peter McRae. His father is out in the woods, and
he's coming tonight or tomorrow. Peter wants to see
you about something and he's hungry. He just whipped
Aleck Curry, and that's why his eye is black and his lip
swollen. Good-by, Peter!"</p>

<p>There was something wholly and beautifully satisfying
about Mona, and Peter felt himself strangely alone
when she left him and he found himself in the cabin
with Simon. And then a thing happened which would
have amazed all the people in Five Fingers could they
have seen it, for Simon McQuarrie, with his honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
heart and hard face, had never revealed himself a man
of emotion. Yet scarcely had Mona gone when he drew
Peter into his arms, and his thin gray face shone with a
strange light as he looked over the boy's head into the
sunset that flooded the open door.</p>

<p>"Peter&mdash;Peter McRae," he said as if speaking to
himself. "Helen's boy&mdash;and Donald's. It's been a
long time since I've seen you, Peter, a long time.
And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held him off and looked at him in a way that
puzzled Peter. "You look like your mother, boy, when
she was a little girl. I knew her then."</p>

<p>Peter was fishing in his pocket.</p>

<p>"My father sent this to you," he said, giving Simon
the bottle.</p>

<p>The Scotchman opened it, and Peter watched his
face as he read what was on the paper. He saw the
lines about Simon's mouth harden and little wrinkles
gather about his eyes. Then he turned, crushing the
paper tightly in one hand, and added half a dozen
slices of bacon to those already in the pan on the stove.
After that he read the paper very deliberately a second
time, and burned it. He cut more bread, brought out
a pie, and while he added finishing touches to a feast
that made Peter's eyes shine, he talked&mdash;but not about
the paper in the bottle. When supper was ready he ate
little himself, but watched the boy. Peter was starved.
When he was done Simon rose to his feet and passed a
big, lean hand over the boy's fair hair. His heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ached. Yet a duty had been imposed upon him, and he
did not draw away from it. Words which Donald
McRae had heavily underscored in the message he had
sent kept repeating themselves in his mind, like a voice
which he could not put off or deny.</p>

<p>"Tell him <i>now</i>, tonight, as soon as he comes to
you," Donald had written. "Before the stars are over
me again I want to feel that he knows the truth, and
understands, and has forgiven me. It may be I am a
coward because I do not tell him myself. But I cannot.
I am afraid. I want to think of him always as
he has been. I cannot leave him with a heart breaking
or his faith dying. God will bless you, Simon. It
is for Peter's sake&mdash;and Helen's&mdash;even more than
mine."</p>

<p>They sat down on a bench, facing the last of the
sunset, and Simon put his arm about the boy's shoulders.
He tried to begin, and something rose in his
throat and choked him so he could not speak. He tried
again, and said:</p>

<p>"So Mona found you, and you fought Aleck Curry
and whipped him?"</p>

<p>"She helped me," confessed Peter. "But I was
empty. I can lick him now, when I'm fed up."</p>

<p>Simon's arm tightened. His long fingers touched
the boy's cheek gently. "You like Mona?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Simon waited. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Do you want me to tell you a story, Peter&mdash;a story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
about another girl like Mona, who lived a long, long
time ago?"</p>

<p>Peter nodded, wondering whether Simon would then
tell him something about the letter that was in the
bottle.</p>

<p>The story was short, for Simon McQuarrie was a
cold and&mdash;most people thought&mdash;an emotionless
man. But his heart was beating painfully as he began
his tale.</p>

<p>"A long time ago there was another girl just like
Mona, and just as lovely and sweet, Peter, and there
were three boys who grew up near her. But one of
these boys was almost a man, much older than the
other two, so that when the girl came to young
womanhood he was really almost old enough to be her
father. And these three all loved her, every one of
them, but one of the three was very much like this
Aleck Curry you fought and had a heart in him that
didn't know what clean love was. Well, of course,
she loved just <i>one</i> of them, Peter, and he was
the best and noblest of the three. Her name was
Helen."</p>

<p>"My mother's name," said Peter quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the odd thing about it is the name of the
man she married was Donald, just like your father's.
That's why I'm telling you the story, Peter. It&mdash;it's
queer."</p>

<p>Peter was silent.</p>

<p>"The man who was almost old enough to be her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
father was glad in a way," went on Simon. "No one
ever knew just how badly it broke him up, but their
happiness in time made him happy, and he was the best
friend they ever had. At least, I think he was. But
the black-hearted one of the three was different, and
one day when Donald and the older man were away he
came to her cabin and insulted her, even though she
had a little baby in her arms. And just then
the other two came back. What would you have done,
Peter?"</p>

<p>Peter's body had stiffened.</p>

<p>"If he was like Aleck Curry&mdash;I'd&mdash;I'd have killed
him," he said.</p>

<p>Simon drew in a deep, slow breath.</p>

<p>"And that is just what happened, Peter. Donald
killed him. He didn't mean to do it. It was an accident.
But it happened. And the other man deserved
it. He was better dead than alive. But it made a
murderer of Donald, and they hang murderers. So
the older man cared for the woman and the baby for
three years, while Donald hid himself in the forests.
Then&mdash;Helen died. And Donald came back and took
the boy, and for years after that the law didn't know
where he was, and they were happy together, and would
always have been happy if the law hadn't found him
again, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Simon's voice choked. His arm hugged Peter until
it hurt. And then he finished, almost whispering the
last words, "Peter, I know it's all true, because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
older man's name was Simon McQuarrie&mdash;and I'm
Simon McQuarrie&mdash;and&mdash;the boy's name&mdash;<i>was
Peter</i>."</p>

<p>It was out. He bowed his grizzled cheek to the
boy's face and fought hard to choke back the thickening
in his throat. It seemed a long time to him that Peter
did not move or speak. But he could feel the tremble
of the boy's body, and he knew that Peter understood.</p>

<p>"So he won't come back," he said, trying to bring a
note of comfort into his strained voice. "At least not
for a long time, Peter. And he wants you to live with
me. That's what he wrote on the paper you brought
in the bottle."</p>

<p>Still Peter did not speak. He was staring through
the door, and it was hard for Simon to find more
words.</p>

<p>"We'll take good care of you here, Peter."</p>

<p>Then Peter spoke.</p>

<p>"Dad won't come back tonight or tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor ever?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll come, but it will be a long time."</p>

<p>"And they're after him, like they were back there in
the woods. They want to&mdash;<i>hang him</i>?"</p>

<p>"They won't catch him, Peter. That is why he left
you here. He can travel faster without you and is safe
right now. But we must tell no one else about him.
We must keep it all between ourselves&mdash;a secret."</p>

<p>Peter slipped out quietly from under Simon's arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
He had no more questions to ask, and Simon made no
effort to follow him as he went out into the last glow of
the day. Slowly Peter walked past the mill and the
yellow sawdust piles toward the timber which axes had
not touched at the edge of the clearing. But he no
longer took notice of the sunset glow or the twitter of
birds or wondered at the molten gleam of the Middle
Finger. He entered into the shadowing twilight of
the forest and for the first time a sob broke from his
dry lips. Then he called his father's name aloud, and
the silence that followed emptied his heart of its last
hope. He sank down in a huddled heap beside a tree,
and his grief found vent in a low sobbing that broke
strangely and terribly in the gloomy stillness of the
trees. It was in this hour that Peter needed the comfort
of a woman's arms. His world was gone. Without
his father he wanted to die.</p>

<p>The darkness crept closer about him. And then a
little hand, timid, soft, touched his cheek.</p>

<p>"Peter!"</p>

<p>It was Mona. Her beautiful eyes were glowing
softly at him in the dusk as he raised his head to look
at her through his tears. She knelt down beside him,
and he choked back his sobs, struggling to hide his grief
and his tears from her. And then Buddy the pup snuggled
under his arm and kissed his cheek with his cool
tongue. Mona was dabbing at his eyes again with
her little handkerchief, and her voice was soft and sweet
in its mothering gentleness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then Peter forgot Simon's warning, and
there in the deepening gloom of the forest, with Mona
close beside him, he told what it was in his
heart to tell&mdash;all about the police, and the fight and
the running away, and now the losing of his father.</p>

<p>"There isn't anyone else but my dad," he half
sobbed at the end. "I even lost my dog. I haven't
got anything now&mdash;an' I wish I was dead!"</p>

<p>"You don't," she reproved, her two hands holding
one of his own tightly, "and you <i>have</i> got someone.
You've got me. I'll take care of you. I will, Peter. I
promise. And you can have Buddy, and all my pets&mdash;everything
I've got. And&mdash;he will come back. Your
father, I mean. All we got to do is wait." Her eyes
were glowing at him in the dusk. "Why, your father
is alive and he <i>can</i> come back," she said straight from
the heart. "Mine can't. He is dead. And so is my
mother."</p>

<p>An emotion new and strange swept over Peter&mdash;a
flash of dawning manhood stirred to mysterious life
by that note of something which had come from Mona's
lips, a woman of the future whispering to him, chivalry
calling, a boy's soul and a girl's rising for a moment
above their years to point out the way to a new tomorrow.</p>

<p>Peter's heart grew warm again. He rose to his
feet, and Mona stood beside him. In the darkness
they were very close.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," he said. "Dad won't stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
away very long. And I&mdash;I'm sorry about your father
and mother, Mona. And if Aleck Curry bothers you
again, or kicks the dog&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so they went back through the dusk to Five
Fingers, and this time it was Peter who held firmly to
Mona's hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">His</span> first night in Five Fingers would always remain
an unchangeable page in the history of
Peter McRae. Time would not dim nor obliterate it
but would only mellow the memory of its loneliness
and its torture. In the hours when it seemed to him
his world had come to an end, years pressed their
weight of experience and understanding upon his
shoulders, and for a little while pain and the poignancy
of fears made him old, and he ceased to be a boy of
fourteen.</p>

<p>Simon McQuarrie had left a candle burning in the
loft of his cabin. By its light he had made Peter's
bed, and had hugged the boy to him for a moment before
saying good night; and in going, with his head and
shoulders above the trap in the floor, he had paused
for a moment to say: "Don't worry, Peter. They
won't get your father. And you must sleep, because
Mona will be looking for you early in the morning."</p>

<p>Then he had gone.</p>

<p>And now, two hours later, Peter was alone and still
awake. The candle had burned out, but the moon was
coming up over the eastern forests. It was a splendid
spring moon, big and round and full of golden fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and its glow came in a flood through the open window
of the loft.</p>

<p>At the window sat Peter, huddled and quiet. He
knew Simon was sound asleep. All of Five Fingers
was asleep. From the window he counted six or seven
of the dozen log homes which made up the little settlement,
and their windows were dark. They were
floating in a great, yellow sea of moonlight. He could
make out the dark walls of the forest and the silvery
sheen of Middle Finger Inlet.</p>

<p>From beyond that sheen came the low murmur of
Lake Superior beating against the rocks half a mile
away. In springtime there was always this moaning
of the big lake at Five Fingers, even on still nights
when there was no wind.</p>

<p>And tonight it was so quiet Peter could hear his own
heart beating. At times it hurt him. It rose up in
him somewhere and choked him. Once or twice, if
Simon had been awake, he could have heard the boy
sobbing.</p>

<p>But Peter was beyond that now. His pale, thin face
looking at the moon over the tree-tops had grown tense
and set in its understanding and grief. Out under that
moon his father was being hunted. Men were after
him&mdash;men who would kill him or hang him if they
caught him. He was no longer puzzled. His father
was gone forever, just as his mother was gone, only
she was dead.</p>

<p>He gulped hard, and his fingers clutched at the rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
wood of the windowsill. He could not remember his
mother except as a beautiful dream. She had come to
him sometimes that way, and he had felt the soft
warmth of her hands and the sweet breath of her
kisses in his sleep. In his brain he treasured a picture
of her, but it was only a picture, while his father had
been very real. Since the first day he could remember,
it was his father who had made up his world, his
father who had been pal, comrade and mother to him all
his life, and who now&mdash;out under the light of the
wonderful moon&mdash;was being hunted by men with guns,
just as they had so often hunted the big white rabbits
in the swamps.</p>

<p>Again and again as he sat alone at the window his
mind went over the events which had passed so swiftly
since the day before yesterday, when his father galloped
in from the railroad settlement with the officers of the
law at his heels, and together they ran into the safety
of the woods, leaving the little cabin in the clearing
which had been their home. After that had come the
longer flight, two days and nights of exhaustion and
hunger, and the final parting when they heard the
axes of the men at Five Fingers. It was when he came
to that point his heart rose up and choked him, and he
wanted to cry out in the stillness of the night. If only
his father had put greater faith in his strength and
years, and had let him go along! He could run, and
hide, and live without anything to eat for a long time,
and he could sleep on the naked ground, and swim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
streams, and he wasn't afraid. But his father had sent
him on alone to this strange settlement of Five Fingers,
where he had met Mona, and Aleck Curry, and Simon
McQuarrie....</p>

<p>When his thoughts came to Mona a bit of comfort
crept into Peter's soul. It wasn't so bad, with Mona
near him. She had come into his life in a most unexpected
and beautiful way, and had helped him whip
the beast of a boy who had kicked her dog. He could
still feel the warm thrill of her little hand as she led
him through the woods and slashings into Five Fingers
and he could see her eyes glowing at him in the
dusk as she said:</p>

<p>"Your father is alive and he <i>can</i> come back. But
mine can't, Peter. He is dead. And so is my mother."</p>

<p>Peter could almost hear her speaking those words
now, whispering them, as if she realized in that instant
the sacredness of the trust he had put in her. And she
was right. His father was alive, and could come back,
while hers....</p>

<p>The distant murmuring of the lake came to him
faintly. It made him shiver. Out there, somewhere,
her father and mother had been drowned. He wondered
if Mona was awake and was also listening to
that sound, so faint at times that it was like a breath
of air. It must haunt her, he thought. It was always
telling her about what had happened, just as she had
told it to him, coming down the slope into Five
Fingers, and probably it made her cry when she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
alone nights. It was terrible to remember one's father
and mother dying like that, both at once, and Peter
shuddered.</p>

<p>It made him a little ashamed, too. The sense of
manhood which his father had planted and nurtured
in him began to rise above his own hopelessness and
heartache, and he leaned out of the window to look at
the cabin of Pierre and Josette Gourdon, where Mona
lived. That was dark, too. But Mona might be awake.
He hoped so. Next to his father she was the biggest
thing that had ever come into his life, and thought of
her, and of her nearness, and of her lying awake
thinking about him, sent a warm and comforting
feeling through him, just as her gentle hands and
soft eyes had brought him a mothering consolation
in the earlier darkness of the forest that
night.</p>

<p>It seemed to him, now that the reaction had come
in his mind, that everything about the night was assuming
a new aspect.</p>

<p>It was the kind of night he and his father loved, and
its stillness, its shadows and floods of yellow moonlight
brought him a new message. <i>Their</i> moon, they had
always called it.</p>

<p>"You were born on a night with the moon shining
like that," his father had told him. "It came in
at the window to look at you, and it was mighty
pleased."</p>

<p>So the moon had always been a personal thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Peter, just as it had been to his father. And the Man
in the Moon, Peter observed, was in a friendly humor
tonight. There was a sly look in his eyes and an odd
twist to his mouth, as if he were winking at Peter and
telling him how beautifully everything was coming out,
both for his father and for himself. Between Mona
and the moon the sickness grew less in his heart, and
remembering he had not said the prayer which
his father had never let him forget, he bowed his face
on the windowsill and whispered the words to
himself.</p>

<p>When he raised his head a big gray shadow was
floating silently in the air just outside his window.
It was one of the huge owls which turn snow-white in
winter. He could hear the soft flutter of its wings as
it twisted and turned and disappeared, more like a
ghost than a living thing. And then a swift patter of
little feet came on the roof of the cabin. It was another
of the night folk, a flying squirrel. A few yards
away was the big tree in which it must hide itself during
the day. He wondered if the owl and the winged
squirrel were among Mona's pets.</p>

<p>His ears began to attune themselves to the different
sounds of the night. It wasn't so empty, after all.
There was always the murmur of the lake, and he could
hear the occasional soft thud of hoofs in the meadow,
and the mooing of a cow. A loon sent out its quavering
love call from somewhere beyond the dark wall of
the forest, and a wolf howled to the north. Now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
then, deep in his sleep, Simon McQuarrie gave
a snort in the room below. It was as if he were under
water and came up at intervals for air, Peter
thought.</p>

<p>Then he heard an odd chuckling, and a porcupine
came waddling through the moonlight toward the cabin.
Peter could see him clearly. He was big and fat and
stupidly happy, and chattered like a cooing baby as he
approached Simon's woodpile. And at last the tenseness
went out of Peter's face, and his eyes brightened in
the moonglow, and he pursed up his lips to whistle
down softly at Porky. He wanted to warn him of the
doom which Mona had said hovered over all porcupines
at Five Fingers. But the creature was deaf and dumb
and blind. He found the axe which Simon had forgotten,
and grunted his satisfaction. Then he humped
himself into a comfortable ball and his teeth began
working like swiftly beating little hammers upon the
helve of the axe, which was salty with the sweat of
Simon's hands. Peter whistled.</p>

<p>"Get out, Porky!" he called softly.</p>

<p>He was considering the necessity of going down to
save Simon's axe when a second chattering shadow
waddled in out of the moonlit open between the cabin
and the forest. It was another porcupine, a huge, black
fellow who was carrying on an animated debate with
himself as he advanced. Peter grinned. He loved
to hear the porcupines talk to themselves. But he had
never heard one quite like the big black fellow. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
as if a mother pig were coming with a litter of little
grunting ones at her heels, and he wondered if Simon
would sleep through it all.</p>

<p>The newcomer made straight for the woodpile and
the gray possessor of the axe helve turned to meet him.
The axe was between them, a sweet morsel for porcupine
teeth. Low, throaty sounds floated up to Peter.
It might have been a meeting of brothers, or of sweethearts,
or at least of very good friends if one judged by
those sounds.</p>

<p>Then came a swift, flail-like movement of tails,
followed by grunts and squeals and blows that sent a
thrill of excitement through Peter. It was a glorious
fight from the beginning, and somehow the big black
fellow made him think of Aleck Curry, and in his
eagerness to see the battle he leaned half out of the
window.</p>

<p>The fighters rolled directly under him and he heard
loose quills flying against the cabin as the tails struck
out like clubs.</p>

<p>For a time he could not see who was getting the bad
end of it. Then the black, who was more than ever
like Aleck Curry, got a swing from the gray's tail that
must have filled him with quills wrong-side in, for he
let out a wail and began to retreat.</p>

<p>Not until then did Peter hear a sound from the room
below him. A door opened. In another moment Simon
McQuarrie came round the end of the cabin.</p>

<p>Simon was a tall and ghostly figure in his nightgown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which fell to his knees, and in his hand he carried a
club. The club rose and fell and Peter heard a sickening
blow. A feeling of horror shot through him.</p>

<p>"Don't kill the white one!" he cried. "Don't kill it!"</p>

<p>Simon McQuarrie, about to make for his second
victim, looked up at the window in surprise. Peter saw
the gray porcupine ambling back toward the timber,
grunting and protesting as he went, and Simon made
no effort to overtake him.</p>

<p>"They were having a fine fight," explained Peter.
"That black one was Aleck Curry, and the other was
licking him. He was smaller, too."</p>

<p>For a space the Scotchman stood silent in the moonlight.
Then he asked, "Have you been asleep, Peter?"</p>

<p>Peter shook his head. "No."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Just looking at the moon."</p>

<p>Simon turned slowly, with a suspicious upward
glance at Peter.</p>

<p>"Better go now," he advised. "If you don't I'll
ask you to come down and sleep with me." As he
disappeared round the end of the cabin, his scant nightgown
flapping above his long and bony legs, Simon
muttered under his breath: "Donald was wrong in
having me tell the lad. Better to have lied and never
let him know. As it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>An expression which only Donald McRae would
have understood settled in his face, and he paused for
a moment at his door to look across the open where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Pierre Gourdon's home lay in the radiance of the night.
He could see the window of the room in which Mona
slept, and the lines about his stern mouth softened.</p>

<p>"Poor little devils, both of them," he said, and went
in to his bed.</p>

<p>Peter heard the door close. It seemed easier for
him now to lie down upon the blankets. The moonlight
streamed in upon him, and Peter could <i>feel</i> it.
There was always that something warm and comforting
about the moon. He closed his eyes, and his
thoughts no longer brought a lump into his throat or
hurt him. It was as if an older mind were helping him
over certain difficult places. It assured him his father
was safe. The police would not get him, and it would
not be long before he returned. If he failed to do
that he would surely write, and Peter could then go to
him.</p>

<p>He began to think of Mona. She was, after all, the
pleasantest thing he had ever had to think about, in
spite of his happiness with his father. He reviewed the
fight of that day and grew warm with anticipations of
tomorrow and a renewal of hostilities. His hands
clenched when he pictured Aleck Curry with his ugly
face and big, heavy body, but they relaxed when he
visioned Mona as she had taken part in the fight, with
her shining black hair streaming about her and flaming
eyes so beautiful he had at first been afraid to look
at them. In his life in the wilderness he had never
had much to do with girls, but here was one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pleased him completely, and all the ideals which his
father had built up in him were roused and set on
fire. His mother must have been like Mona when she
was a little girl, because it seemed to him his father
had always pictured her like that.</p>

<p>Then he grew uneasy and shame crept a little upon
him. It made him squirm in his blankets to think that
Aleck Curry would have whipped him if Mona hadn't
joined in those last two or three minutes of the fight.
That Aleck was bigger and older than he, and that he
had fought under the disadvantages of hunger and
exhaustion, did not satisfactorily explain his own failure
to Peter. He was glad his father had not seen
that fight, even though he had been taken at a great
disadvantage. But <i>Mona</i> had seen it. She had seen
him on the ground in those final moments, with Aleck
about to pommel him into disgraceful submission, and
she had come in to save him.</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do under the circumstances,
and the inspiration of it comforted him. He
would go out early in the morning, hunt up Aleck Curry
and lick him. He was sure he could do it now, even
though he was smaller and lighter than Aleck, for he
would be rested and would have a good breakfast to
start with.</p>

<p>He fell asleep. The big owl hooted softly from the
top of a stub near the mill, and the flying squirrel was
joined by its mate in a game of tag on the roof. The
moon sailed higher, and under it a buck and a doe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
crossed within a stone's throw of Peter's window. All
this Peter missed in an excitement of his own as his
unsettled mind traveled swiftly from one dream to
another. First he was fleeing with his father, and
they were pursued by a horde of enemies, and all of
these enemies were Aleck Currys. After that he
dreamed of Aleck and Mona, and he fought so fiercely,
with Mona's dark eyes and hair filling his vision,
that Simon heard him twisting and groaning and
climbed quietly up the ladder from below to look at
him.</p>

<p>For a long time the stern Scotchman watched Peter,
and in the fainter light of the moon which now filled
the room a miracle of change passed over his face and
it became as gentle as a woman's. No one, since long
years ago, had ever caught that gentleness in Simon
McQuarrie's face.</p>

<p>"It seems only yesterday," he whispered softly
to himself, in a moment when Peter's pale face lay
quietly in the crook of his arm. "Only yesterday,
Helen."</p>

<p>Something trembled inside him, and he knew the
mother was in that room with Peter, watching over
him as he had seen her many times in those years when
he had cared for the two, those beautiful but pitiless
years when he had hardened his heart against all hope
for himself in his devotion and duty to his hunted
friend, Donald McRae. Only yesterday! And yet
many hard and tedious years had passed since then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and through them he had gone like a piece of iron that
is hardened into steel by the alchemy of fire. Tonight
had come the mysterious change. He climbed down
softly, his heart trembling. He loved Peter. He
loved him as he had loved the mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> awoke with the dawn, and with that dawn
he saw Five Fingers rousing itself into life.
All the sweetness of spring was in the air. The
delicious morning song of the robins was the first
cheering sound that came to him. It was like a beautiful
chorus.</p>

<p>"A man cannot be so wicked that the song of a
robin will not stir some good in his heart," Donald
McRae had taught Peter. "God made that song to
begin the day with, and only those buried in the darkness
of cities cannot hear or understand the message.
Always think kindly of people in the cities, Peter. They
are unfortunate."</p>

<p>And Peter thought of that as he looked out of the
window on the few log cabins at Five Fingers. He
had never seen a real city, but here, with the rose-flush
of the rising sun painting the eastern sky beyond the
forests, was everything of beauty and glory his mind
could conceive. "Here," he seemed to hear his father
saying, "is God."</p>

<p>Silvery wreaths of smoke were rising from the stone
and clay chimneys of Five Fingers. He heard the
gulls and caught the flash of their white wings over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the Middle Inlet. Down there, too, was the squat,
black tug owned by Aleck Curry's father&mdash;the tug
which came up from Fort William three or four times
a year to carry the lumber away. It was the one ugly
thing he could see, and he was glad it did not belong
at Five Fingers, and that Aleck Curry did not belong
there. Already he was taking a possessive interest in
the place, and his heart felt a gloating pride in the fact
that he was a part of it, and Aleck Curry wasn't.</p>

<p>He saw men coming up from the bottoms, leading
horses. A cheery whistle came to him clearly. The
mill, nearly buried in its big yellow piles of sawdust,
was only a little distance away, and a man was stoking
the boiler with wood. The cloud of smoke that rose
out of the tall stack was white and clean, and Peter
knew how sweetly it smelled. He sniffed, trying to
catch it. And then a wriggling creature came under
his window and began making contortions as it looked
up at Peter. It was Buddy, the pup. He was just the
kind of dog Peter loved, all knots and knobs, with big
feet and joints and a head twice too heavy for his
body.</p>

<p>"He's growing," thought Peter, as he called down
to him. "He's going to be a fine dog."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Poleon Dufresne passed Simon's
cabin with a pail of milk and heard the Scotchman
whistling. This was unusual, and he paused to thrust
in a curious face at the door, smiling good morning.
Simon was getting breakfast with an almost boyish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
enthusiasm, and when Poleon saw Peter scrubbing his
face his jaws fell apart in amazement.</p>

<p>"Morning, Poleon," greeted Simon. "This is Peter&mdash;Peter
McRae, and I've adopted him. He's the son of
an old friend of mine, and he came last night as a sort
of surprise. He's going to bide with me."</p>

<p>This was a lot of information for Simon to give on
any one subject at any one time, and Poleon came in
with his pail, grinning his appreciation. He laid a hand
affectionately on Peter's shoulder and told him how
glad the people in Five Fingers would be to have him
among them. Peter liked Poleon's round, rosy face
with its cheery blue eyes, and when about to go Poleon
turned a third of the contents of his pail into an
earthenware crock and said to Peter:</p>

<p>"That's for you, boy. Simon here doesn't care for
milk, but he must get plenty of it now for you. There's
nothing like milk to make you fat and healthy."</p>

<p>It was Saturday. Peter learned that fact half an
hour later while he was helping Simon wash the breakfast
dishes. It came from a voice behind them, and
Peter turned to find Mona standing in the door.</p>

<p>"It's Saturday and there is no school," she announced.
"So I have come to get you acquainted with
Five Fingers, Peter."</p>

<p>An enormous thrill ran through Peter. She was
even lovelier than yesterday as she stood with her slim
little figure framed in the doorway. Her beautiful dark
eyes were shining, and looking at him, and her wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
black hair was plaited in a braid that looked like a
rope of velvet. Even Simon's undemonstrative face
broke into an appreciative smile.</p>

<p>Once he had told Pierre Gourdon it was not good for
a child to be as beautiful as Mona. But a new thought
came into his mind this morning, a strange and weird
thought for a Scotchman of his nature, and he chuckled
softly as he told Peter to wipe his hands and go with
Mona. Then he went to her, and tilted up her pretty
chin, and ran his hand over her smooth hair that was
like silk to his work-hardened palm. He had never
done that before, and Mona was surprised. She was
surprised, too, at the changed look in his face and
eyes. He seemed to be a different Simon McQuarrie
from the one she had always known.</p>

<p>"So you helped Peter whip that young rascal Aleck
Curry, did you?" he asked with a wicked note of exultation
in his voice.</p>

<p>She flushed a little and cast a swift glance at Peter.</p>

<p>"Peter had him whipped when I went in," she replied
loyally.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," corrected Peter. "He was just
going to mess me up in proper shape when you hit
him with the stick. But I can lick him today."</p>

<p>Mona smiled proudly at him. Then she looked
sternly at Simon.</p>

<p>"You killed one of my porcupines."</p>

<p>"I had to," explained Simon. "He was eating my
axe. Peter will take him over to the cemetery for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>He returned to his work and Peter and Mona went to
the dead porcupine. Buddy was sniffing suspiciously
at the corpse, and at sight of the red stains on the earth
Mona shivered.</p>

<p>"He didn't need to kill it," she said. "I heard you
call to him to let the white one go. He could have let
this one go, too."</p>

<p>"You heard me?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "I saw the candle in your room until
it went out. Then I sat at the window in the moonlight.
I didn't feel like sleeping."</p>

<p>"Neither did I," said Peter, his heart beating
strangely. "I&mdash;I was wondering if you were awake.
Did you hear the lake?"</p>

<p>"I always hear it."</p>

<p>He picked up the dead porcupine, feeling that he
had said something wrong. Mona took the other foot
and together they carried their burden beyond the
farthest cabin to a high little meadow at the foot of
a green knoll. Here, Peter observed, were many scores
of green little mounds, and many others over which
the grass had not grown, and still others very fresh.
And everywhere among them flowers were growing.
Mona pointed out a spade, and he dug a hole. When
the porcupine was buried, Mona said:</p>

<p>"That is the twenty-seventh this spring. I wonder
why porcupines like cabin doors and windowsills and
axes and table legs when there are so many nice things
to eat in the woods?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's the salt," explained Peter. "They like to eat
anything somebody has handled. Once, when we were
away, they ate our windows until all the glass fell
out."</p>

<p>"I put salt in the woods, lots of it," said Mona. "The
deer like it too, and the rabbits, and the mice, and almost
everything alive except the birds. Uncle Pierre
has the tug bring me a barrel of salt every time it
comes. Last time that beast of an Aleck Curry stole
pepper from the tug's kitchen and put it in my salt."</p>

<p>"I'm going to lick him today," he assured her.</p>

<p>In her possessive little way she took his hand as they
walked back. "I don't want you to fight him, not unless
you have to, Peter. He isn't worth it. You have nice
eyes, and they don't look good swollen half shut. I
wish mine were blue."</p>

<p>"I don't," declared Peter with a suddenness that
startled him. "They're&mdash;they're&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"They're&mdash;awfully pretty," finished Peter bravely.
"I never seen&mdash;I mean I never <i>saw</i> such pretty eyes."</p>

<p>He felt like wriggling down into his collar, and
looked away from her. Mona blushed, and if Peter had
observed he would have seen her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"And I wish I had light hair, too&mdash;like yours," she
added.</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i>," he fought manfully. "Your hair is&mdash;prettier
than your eyes. When I first saw you, there
in the sun, I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you think?" she asked with interest.</p>

<p>"I dunno. I dunno what I thought."</p>

<p>He was tremendously uncomfortable, and was glad
the musical droning of the sawmill began just then.
That was another thrill, the clean, high-pitched cutting
of steel through wood. There is something chummy
and companionable about the sound of a sawmill at
work in the heart of a forest country. It is friendly
even to a stranger and makes one feel at home, and
when Mona and Peter came to the mill the half-dozen
men there were going about their duties as if they were
a pleasure instead of work. They were a happy lot.
Peter could see that with his boyish eyes, and his heart
responded quickly to the gladdening pulse of it.</p>

<p>Then Mona ran up quickly behind a man who was
twisting a log with a long cant hook and tried to cover
his eyes with her hands. In a moment the man had
turned and had her up off the ground, tight in his arms.
Mona kissed him, and Peter thought he had never seen
the face of any man filled with a happiness like that
which he saw in Pierre Gourdon's. And Mona, holding
out her hand to Peter, said:</p>

<p>"This is my Uncle Pierre. Come and kiss him,
Peter."</p>

<p>And there, with both the young folk in his arms, and
the big, steel saw laughing and wailing in their ears,
Pierre Gourdon, into whose heart God had put a passionate
love for all children, kissed Peter. In thus
welcoming the boy he drew him so close that for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
instant Peter's face touched Mona's soft cheek, and
so warm and sweet was it that through all the years
that followed Peter never forgot that wonderful moment.</p>

<p>Then Pierre Gourdon said, holding Peter off at
arm's length, and looking at his eye which was still
dark, and his lip which was swollen: "So you are the
young man who whipped Aleck Curry for annoying
Mona? Why, Aleck is half again as big as you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I didn't whip him," interrupted Peter. "Not
alone. I was tired and empty as a drum. He was
licking me when Mona jumped in. She helped a lot."</p>

<p>Laughter filled Pierre's eyes, and then a shadow followed
it. The gentleness in his face gave way to a
stern resolution.</p>

<p>"Aleck is not a good boy," he said. "I will not have
him troubling you, Mona. If he does it again you must
tell me."</p>

<p>"She needn't do that," protested Peter quickly. "I'll
take care of her. I'm going to lick Aleck Curry today."</p>

<p>Pierre Gourdon looked at the boy, and the sternness
left his face. "Peter, you're a man. I love boys like
you." He ran his hand over Mona's silken hair, just
as Simon McQuarrie had done. "I guess I won't worry
over you and Aleck any more, <i>Ange</i>. I think Peter is
going to do what he says."</p>

<p>"I won't have him fight Aleck," declared Mona. "If
he does, I'll fight, too!"</p>

<p>When they had left Pierre and were going toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the Gourdon cabin, Peter asked, "What did he mean
when he called you <i>Ange</i>?"</p>

<p>"It's a name he gave me the day he brought me
out of the water when my mother and father were
drowned," explained Mona softly. "It means something
much nicer than I am."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Peter. "What does it
mean?"</p>

<p>"Angel."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Peter was silent for several moments. Then
he said: "I like it. I guess that was what I must have
been thinking when I saw you first yesterday, there
in the sun, with your hair all down and the flowers
around you. First off you sort of scared me."</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> have looked ugly enough to scare anyone,"
agreed Mona depreciatively. "But I like my hair down
when I'm alone in the woods."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Peter. "And you wasn't ugly.
What's that building down there, with the box-like
thing on top of it? Looks like a church."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;and our school. Uncle Joe's wife, Marie
Antoinette, teaches us. She's beautiful, Peter. Uncle
Pierre says she is as lovely as Aunt Josette was when
she was young. Aunt Josette is beautiful, too. You've
been to school a lot, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Not so much."</p>

<p>"But you talk well."</p>

<p>"My father taught me. Every day I studied, and
he heard my lessons, even when we were on the trail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
My dad was&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped, the odd thickening
coming in his throat again.</p>

<p>"I love your father," said Mona gently. "Last night
I prayed he'd come back, and he will. Uncle Pierre
says it was prayer that brought me to him. He says
prayer is always answered, if you believe hard enough."</p>

<p>"My dad says that, too."</p>

<p>"And I'm going to pray every night, Peter. I'm
going to pray for your father to come back. <i>And he
will.</i>"</p>

<p>The little doubt which had planted itself like a seed
in Peter's mind was growing in spite of Mona and the
beauty at Five Fingers. "If he comes back they may
catch him," he said. "And if they do that&mdash;&mdash;" She
saw a queer, twisted look like a shadow in his face, and
her fingers tightened. "They'll kill him," he finished.
"That's what Simon McQuarrie says."</p>

<p>After a moment Mona said: "I wish we could tell
Uncle Pierre. He always brings things out right. And
this is coming out right, too, Peter. I know it."</p>

<p>Without logic, she was sweetly comforting. Her
gentle assurance was a buoy to which Peter's courage
and hope clung tenaciously, and he stole a hungry look
at her when her eyes were turned away, and his heart
beat fast. In a vague and unanalytical way the thought
was in his mind that God could not help answering
Mona's prayers. If He did not, there could be no
God. And he was sure there was one&mdash;just as sure
as he was of the trees and flowers and birds and blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sky all about them. Donald McRae had planted that
faith deeply in his boy.</p>

<p>"Did you ever have many prayers answered?" he
asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, when I prayed <i>hard</i>," she replied. "I'm praying
for something to happen to Aleck Curry, too. And
it's going to happen, Peter. I know it's going to happen."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Anything&mdash;almost. I wish the crows would pull
his hair out!"</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped herself with a jerk. "There he
is now&mdash;down there on the Finger. He is throwing
stones at my gulls!"</p>

<p>"I'll stop him," said Peter, starting off.</p>

<p>She caught him by the arm. "I won't like you if you
fight. Aunt Josette and Marie Antoinette are waiting
for us, and they won't like you either."</p>

<p>She took possession of him again, and Peter gave
himself up, though he could hear a challenging shout
coming faintly from Aleck. And then out of the door
of one of the cabins came a tall, slim woman with a
face so sweet in its smile of welcome that Peter smiled
back shyly, even before Mona had said, "This is my
Aunt Josette."</p>

<p>For an hour after that he was meeting people at Five
Fingers. First there was Marie Antoinette, who was
younger than Aunt Josette, but only a little prettier,
Peter thought, and who said she would have a place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
him in school next Monday morning. From one cabin
to another Mona made him go with her, until he had
met the Poulins and Dufresnes and Croissets and
Clamarts and children and babies until he began to
have trouble in remembering their names.</p>

<p>Then they came to the last cabin of all, and this cabin
looked like a doll's house to Peter. And the person
they found in it was like a doll, too. At first Peter
thought she was a playmate of Mona's, for she was
only a little taller, with blue eyes and red lips and gold-brown
curls tied back with a ribbon. Mona introduced
her proudly.</p>

<p>"This is Adette Clamart, Peter&mdash;Jame Clamart's
wife, and she <i>graduated</i> from the school of Ste. Anne
de la Perade before Jame brought her to Five Fingers!
And the baby&mdash;&mdash;" She dragged him to the side of a
crib and Peter looked down upon the round, cheerful
face of young Telesphore Clamart, eight months old.
Telesphore eyed Peter speculatively for a moment and
then his countenance broke into a smile and he held
up a pair of chubby arms. Mona uttered a gasp of
delight. "He likes you, Peter! Put your head down.
He wants to hug you."</p>

<p>Peter felt himself growing red and hot as he bowed
his head to young Telesphore. The baby dug his fingers
in his hair and squealed in triumph. It was the
first baby he had ever touched, and suddenly he forgot
the two girls and his embarrassment as he felt a soft
little mouth touching his cheek. He laughed back at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Telesphore, and when the baby freed his hair and he
stood up straight again he thought Adette's eyes, bright
with the glory of motherhood, were almost as beautiful
as Mona's. He fumbled in his pockets to find something
for Telesphore and produced his jack-knife.</p>

<p>"You can have that," he said, speaking directly at
Telesphore.</p>

<p>When they were about to go Adette put her hand
affectionately on his shoulder. "Mona told us what
happened yesterday in the woods, Peter, and Jame and
I love you for giving Aleck Curry that beating. It was
splendid of you to fight for Mona like that!"</p>

<p>In the clearing Peter said to Mona: "It isn't true.
I didn't lick Aleck Curry. Why do you tell them
that?"</p>

<p>"It is true," retorted Mona with an obstinate little
toss of her head.</p>

<p>"I was getting the worst of it when you came in with
the stick."</p>

<p>"No, you weren't. He was almost choking for
breath. I couldn't help hitting him with the stick&mdash;that's
all." And then she added: "Why is it you
don't want me to think you whipped him? I've told
everybody you <i>did</i>!"</p>

<p>Her question and a quick flash in her eyes sent a little
thrill through Peter. Was it possible Mona really believed
he was getting the best of the fight when she
began pommeling Aleck Curry with the stick? He
flushed as he thought of his position at that moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
flat on his back with his legs in the air and his arms
helpless under Aleck's weight, and Aleck himself just
on the point of annihilating him! Surely Mona could
not have been blind in those moments. She must
have seen his peril, even if Aleck was panting for
breath. Peter looked at her, trying to measure the truth
of the matter. But Mona's eyes were innocent. If she
was lying to him, she was doing it beautifully.</p>

<p>In a vague sort of way the problem weighed itself
in Peter's mind, and he saw even more clearly that it
was necessary for him to whip Aleck Curry that day.
The responsibility had now become a grim and insistent
one, for if Mona really <i>thought</i> he had whipped Aleck,
he must do it in fact to save his own self-respect; and if
she was shielding him from embarrassment and shame,
as he partly believed, by spreading a false report of the
combat, then it was doubly necessary for him to retrieve
himself and prove his prowess by whipping the
tug master's bullying son.</p>

<p>From the corners of his eyes he began questing for
Aleck, who had disappeared from the strip of sand
below them, though he did this in such a way that
Mona did not guess his intention. She showed him
her pets, and it was then Peter saw something which
he had never seen before, though he loved all wild
things. At Mona's soft little calls the big-eyed moose
birds which Peter called whisky jacks fluttered about
her and ate crumbs out of her hands. Down on the
white sand of the Middle Finger the gulls gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
close about them, like a flock of chickens, begging in
soft, throaty notes for the tidbits which she had brought
from the cabin. She sat down in the sand and they
climbed over her lap. One huge white fellow pecked
at her shining braid.</p>

<p>"That's Bobo," she explained. "He always wants
to eat my hair!" A one-legged gull hopped on her lap
and began eating greedily the handful of bread-crumbs
which she offered him. "And this is Dominique. I call
him that to tease Dominique Beauvais, who is so fat
and round. I don't know how he lost his leg, but I
believe Aleck Curry must have shot it off a year ago.
I wish Aleck's father would never bring him here
again!"</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was almost noon when Peter left Mona and returned
to Simon McQuarrie's cabin. His head was
in a whirl and his heart stirred uneasily between joy and
grief. Not for many minutes at a time had his thoughts
been away from his father. Even when Mona's dark
eyes were smiling at him and her sweet voice was
talking to him, his father's white and hunted face was
a vision that never quite faded out of his momentary
flashes of happiness. Deep down in his heart was an
emptiness which even Mona could not fill, an aching
pain which her beauty and her gentleness softened but
could not quite drive away.</p>

<p>And Mona tried. In her heart, which was sometimes
a woman's heart in a child's breast, she knew that
Peter was grieving and fighting to hide his grief. The
tragedy in her own life, and a sorrow which had been
deeper and more pitiless than Peter's, made her understand
and feel what even Adette in her young motherhood
might not have sensed so clearly.</p>

<p>It seemed only yesterday to Mona that her mother
had laughed and played with her under the big, white
sails of the ship, with her father watching them, and
only yesterday that the terrible thing had happened in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the sea. No one, not even Pierre Gourdon, knew how
vividly those hours and days came back to her at times.
The forest and the wild things shared her secret, but
no others. Over the two graves in the little cemetery
at Five Fingers she had said quietly to Peter that morning,
"My father and mother, Peter"&mdash;and that was all.</p>

<p>Something in her voice held Peter from asking for
the story of that frightful hour in the maelstroms of
the Pit, where Pierre Gourdon had saved her and her
father and mother had died. But he felt it. It crept
into him and became a part of him, and even Pierre
Gourdon would have found it difficult to explain what
was born in their hearts in those moments when Peter
looked at the big stone into which had been roughly cut
the words, "Paul and Mona Guyon, Died Sept. 27,
1900"&mdash;and then said gently to the girl who stood
fighting bravely at his side, "I'm sorry, Mona." For
to Pierre they were children.</p>

<p>But there was something in Peter's soul that was
struggling beyond childhood as he returned to Simon's
cabin. Three days, and this day most of all, had shown
him his first dim vision of the bridge which spans the
illusive way between boy and man. He had lost his
father. But his father was not dead, while Mona's
was gone forever. Out of the chaos in his mind these
facts kept repeating themselves, and with them came
ever more insistently the desire to do something for
Mona. And one possible achievement loomed big&mdash;the
whipping of Aleck Curry!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Thought of it made his blood tingle. He did not
ask himself what it was that Aleck had done to incur
Mona's displeasure. It was sufficient for him to know
that she was praying for calamity to fall upon his head.
She wanted the crows to pull his hair out. She had
prayed for that last night&mdash;when she had prayed for his
father. And she was sure that God answered prayer.</p>

<p>But it was his own feud with Aleck that fired
both his chivalry and his hatred&mdash;memory of that moment
in which the tug master's son had thrust Mona's
head back brutally in the edge of the forest, with his
big, coarse hands fastened in her hair. In his first
encounter with Aleck he had saved Mona but had
failed to avenge the outrage. He was sure he could
do it now.</p>

<p>Simon took him among the men after dinner and he
became acquainted with them all. They went back into
the cuttings, and it was three o'clock before Peter found
himself alone. Then, instead of going back to Mona,
he circled in the edge of the timber until he came to
the end of the finger of evergreens that reached almost
to the inlet. His heart gave a jump when he saw Aleck
on the tug shooting at the flying gulls with a slung-shot.
Peter had made up his mind to challenge his
enemy calmly and without excitement, as his father
would undoubtedly have challenged a man in a similar
situation. But his plan changed suddenly. He picked
up a stone and hurled it with such accuracy that Aleck,
seeing the missile, dodged. Then he jumped ashore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter waited for him. He was not afraid, but his
heart was beating fast. Aleck seemed to have grown
considerably overnight, Peter thought. He was almost
as big as Jame Clamart, and his face was red with an
exultant passion as he advanced, stuffing the slung-shot
into one of his pockets. There was no doubt this was
just the opportunity Aleck was looking for, and Peter
retreated with caution into the balsams and cedars.</p>

<p>Aleck began to run&mdash;and Peter ran. He was light
as a rabbit on his feet, and as he hopped over logs and
underbrush he heard Aleck crashing like a big animal
behind him. Twice he allowed his enemy to come
almost within reach of him, and then spurted ahead.
At last, in the edge of a little cut-over clearing, Aleck
stopped. He was puffing and blowing and his fat face
was covered with sweat.</p>

<p>"Runny-cat!" he choked derisively. "Runny-cat&mdash;runny-cat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught himself in amazement as Peter turned
and advanced toward him. "Always smile when you're
in a tight place," Peter's father had taught him, and
Peter tried bravely to live up to the rule. A fixed grin
was on his face. "I'm going to lick you," he announced
cheerfully. "You're nothing but a girl-beater and a
windbag, an' your wind's all gone. I wasn't running
<i>away</i> from you, Fatty&mdash;I was leadin' you <i>on</i>!"</p>

<p>Aleck stood aghast, gulping hard to get his breath.
It seemed impossible that a boy so much smaller than
himself would dare face him with such monumental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
nerve. The bully in him was maddened by Peter's next
insult. "You're nothing but a girl-fighter&mdash;a hair-puller&mdash;a
big tub of fat," Peter informed him, "an'
you'll be yelling for help when I get half done with
you!"</p>

<p>And then Peter jumped in. He was quick. His fists
were small but hard. His wind was good. And the
suddenness of his attack took Aleck off his guard. The
first blow was what Peter called a stomacher, and Aleck
let out a huge grunt. He bellowed anathema as he
began to swing his heavy arms. Peter reached his
nose and one eye and his mouth. He was like a hornet.
His two small fists were swiftly moving hammers, and
Aleck had never experienced anything like the hail of
their blows. They took away from him what breath
he had left; his nose began to bleed, his lip was cut, and
then Peter gave him another stomacher. Could he
have lasted for five minutes at the speed he was going,
Aleck would have been a wreck.</p>

<p>But Peter was delivering all his metal in one smashing
broadside. Aleck floundered and puffed. One eye
closed quickly. Blood smeared his face and shirt. His
big mouth began to swell. He was not fighting muscle
and brawn&mdash;but <i>nerves</i>. Every nerve in Peter's body
was at its breaking point, and he was like a thing gone
mad. But he was beating against a mass of dull and
stupid flesh that had but few nerves to be shocked into
submission. His blows began to carry less force, and
he was compelled to breathe with his mouth open. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
gave Aleck one last slashing cut in the mouth and then
his strength seemed to break. His enemy's arms tightened
around him and they went down together. Peter
was under, just as in that other tragic moment when
Mona had saved him. But there was no Mona to save
him now, not even Buddy to nip at Aleck's legs and
heels. His one consolation was a final look at Aleck's
face close above him. He had done a pretty good job,
anyway. In another minute or two the bully would
have quit.</p>

<p>Both rested, gaining their breath. Then Aleck began
to pommel, weighting Peter down with his entire bulk.</p>

<p>"I got you now," he managed to gasp. "I got you!"</p>

<p>Peter saved his breath. He realized the futility of
struggling against that weight with what little strength
was in him and concentrated all his effort in shielding
his face. Aleck was like a porpoise, and every half-minute
or so was compelled to cease his jabbing to get
a new supply of breath, a large amount of which he
wasted in verbal laceration of Peter's feelings as he
pommeled with his fists.</p>

<p>"I'm a tub of fat, am I?" he demanded at the beginning
of each fresh attack. "I'm a windbag, eh? A
girl-beater, am I? Take that, an' that, an' <i>that</i>! An'
yell for your girl, Petey, yell for your girl to come an'
help you!"</p>

<p>Then he would pause again to gather lung momentum
for another attack. Each assault left Peter a little
bit more helpless than before. He could feel himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
swelling. One eye, he knew was entirely shut. The
other he saved by shielding it against his arm. His
thoughts were growing a little hazy, too, but all his
mental and physical discomfort was dissipated by the
threat of a new horror which came in a sudden inspiration
of triumph from Aleck's swollen lips.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to yell for Mona," he said. "I'm goin' to
have her come and see what I've done to you! A tub
of <i>fat</i>, am I? Take that&mdash;an' that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he did yell when he got his wind again. In
reality his challenge for Mona to come and see her
Petey licked was husky and not far-reaching, but it
seemed to Peter the whole world must hear it. "An'
when she comes I'm going to make you say you're
licked or I'll beat your head off," Aleck told him. And
then he sat up straight, his heavy bulk astride Peter's
slim body, and called Mona's name again. Peter's
brain went hot. Was this to be the answer to Mona's
prayer? Had Mona really prayed, or had she fooled
him? Faith rode over his doubt. Mona wouldn't lie.
She had prayed, and the trouble right now was with
him&mdash;and not with Mona's prayer.</p>

<p>Aleck's swollen face was growing purple in its vociferous
calling for Mona. In a moment of safety Peter
took a look at it with his one good eye. A thrill shot
through him when he found the weakness had left
his arms. He was breathing easily, too, in spite of
Aleck's weight. If he could only get up&mdash;if he could
have just one more chance at that fat, swollen face&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was something quicker than Peter himself that
moved him, an intuitive flash, a lightning-swift call of
his brain upon hidden forces of self-preservation within
him&mdash;a twist, a convulsion of his body, a squirming
upheaval so sudden and unexpected that Aleck lost his
balance with Mona's name half out of his mouth, and
the other half never came. He fell sprawling, and
Peter was upon him again like a cat. Aleck's face was
his target, and he beat it&mdash;fast, furious and hard. He
was amazed at the return of his strength. It exhilarated
and inspired him, and in his mad enthusiasm he
bit one of Aleck's ears. A roar of pain came from the
bully. Peter's fist lodged squarely in Aleck's eye, and
a second howl followed the first.</p>

<p>At heart the tug-master's boy was a coward, like
every bully, and in another minute he was crying for
quarter. But Peter's momentum was too great to be
stopped on such short notice. He continued, until in
the end Aleck Curry was a blubbering, wind-broken,
thoroughly whipped rascal, hiding his face in the earth.</p>

<p>Not until then did Peter stand up, seeing the world
dimly with one eye. And then&mdash;in that glorious moment
of triumph and answered prayer&mdash;his heart
stopped dead in his body for a single moment. Not ten
feet away from him stood Mona! Even with his fading
vision he saw the wild flush in her face and the
joy in her eyes. The truth they betrayed turned his
darkening world suddenly into a paradise. <i>She had seen
him whip Aleck Curry!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned to Aleck. "Get up!" he said. "Get up or
I'll kick in your ribs!"</p>

<p>Aleck dragged himself to his knees, then slouched to
his feet. He was a pitiable sight. His eyes were little
slits. His face was swollen until it looked as though
he had the mumps. He was blubbering and gasping
for his breath, and for a moment he did not see Mona.</p>

<p>"Are you licked?" demanded Peter, coming close to
him.</p>

<p>Aleck drew back and put up a shielding hand. "I
guess I got enough," he conceded.</p>

<p>"If you ain't sure&mdash;I mean if you <i>aren't</i> sure&mdash;I'll
finish it," said Peter.</p>

<p>"I got enough."</p>

<p>"Then gimme the slung-shot."</p>

<p>Aleck surrendered the weapon. In that moment he
caught a dim vision of Mona. He gulped and swallowed
a lump in his throat.</p>

<p>"Now promise Mona you won't bother her any
more. Promise&mdash;or I'll lick you again!"</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"An' you won't throw stones at her gulls?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"All right, Fatty. Now go on back to the tug.
<i>And stay there!</i>"</p>

<p>He watched Aleck until he had disappeared among
the cedars. Then, his business done, he turned toward
Mona. A little shyly, with shining eyes, she came to
him. He wiped his eye. He could just see her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Peter!" she whispered softly. He could feel
her soft little handkerchief at his face, just as he had
felt it that first day in the edge of the forest. And
she was saying, "Peter&mdash;you're glorious!"</p>

<p>And then something happened that sent a tremble
through the world on which Peter stood. Raising herself
on tiptoe, Mona kissed him softly and sweetly on
his swollen lips.</p>

<p>"There, that is what Aleck Curry has wanted all the
time, and I'm <i>giving</i> it to you. Say thank you, Peter!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Peter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> was conscious of the fact that he had lived
a long time in the last three days and four nights.
His adventures during that brief period of time had
run the entire gamut of human emotions, with the possible
exception of a desire to laugh, and his fourteen
years of life seemed entirely out of fact. This philosophy
did not strike Peter, but it did work into the
troubled soul of Simon McQuarrie as he told Pierre
Gourdon why it was that Peter's father was a hunted
man, fleeing for his life, and how it had come about
that Peter was now in Five Fingers seeking refuge
with him.</p>

<p>"And I'm going to keep him," he said. "I love the
boy."</p>

<p>What Simon had to say struck deep into Pierre Gourdon's
heart, for it recalled the day of years ago when he
had made his great fight in the sea to save a strange
woman and her little girl, and had succeeded in bringing
only the child, Mona, ashore. And Mona had grown
to be a part of his soul. So when Simon had finished,
Pierre nodded his head thoughtfully and said:</p>

<p>"Mona brought Peter to me today. He has the making
of a man in him. And he has promised to whip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Aleck Curry if he troubles Mona again." He chuckled
and shrugged his shoulders. "Aleck is almost twice as
big as Peter," he added. "But the boy has courage. It
may happen. And&mdash;we will make this a home for
him, Simon."</p>

<p>"And if that round-headed young blackguard of an
Aleck sets upon Peter again," said Simon slowly, "I'll
make his father take it out of his hide or never sell
him another foot of lumber!"</p>

<p>The gentle smile did not leave Pierre's eyes. A
forest man, and son of many generations of wilderness
people, a warm thrill of superstition and an immeasurable
faith in the God that had made his beautiful
world lay deep in his soul. Simon guessed what was in
his mind when he saw him looking at a green patch
of flower-strewn slope where lay the graves of Mona's
father and mother.</p>

<p>The smile faded slowly from Pierre's face, and a
little of anxiety, of dread almost, replaced it.</p>

<p>"The years have been kind to us," he said, speaking
more to himself than to Simon. "It has been a long
time since Dominique Beauvais and I brought our wives
through these forests for the first time, and now there
are more than fifty of us here&mdash;all our own people and
friends. There has been little of tragedy and much of
happiness. The plot up there is empty&mdash;except for
Mona's people. Sometimes&mdash;I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Peace and comfort have been with us," agreed the
Scotchman. Behind them were the yellow piles of sawdust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and the droning of the big steel saw in Simon's
little mill as it cut its way through the hearts of timber.
Simon loved the mill as Pierre loved the cabins he had
helped to build, for the mill had brought prosperity to
the wilderness people. It had also made necessary the
ugly black tug which lay down in Middle Finger Inlet.
The creases grew deeper in Simon's hard face as his
eyes rested on the tug. "I wish some other man than
Izaak Curry was taking our lumber," he said. "Maybe
I'd like him if it wasn't for his boy. If that ugly lad
ever puts his hands on Peter again, or on Mona&mdash;&mdash;"
He hunched his gaunt shoulders with a suggestive
grunt.</p>

<p>Pierre was looking off toward the timbered line behind
which Lake Superior was hidden, half a mile away.
For a moment after Simon's threatening words he remained
silent. His face was thoughtful.</p>

<p>"It is strange," he said, giving voice to what was in
his mind. "Through children has come most of our
happiness at Five Fingers, Simon&mdash;and all of our
tragedy. It was seven years ago that the strange ship
went to pieces out there and I saved Mona from the
sea. She is one of us now, and if she should be taken
away our hearts would break. And now comes Peter,
whose mother is dead, and whose father is worse than
dead&mdash;for Peter&mdash;because he is an outlaw. It makes
me think of a long time ago when a boy came into Ste.
Anne de Beaupré, away down on the St. Lawrence,
just as Peter came to Five Fingers three days ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
His father and mother were dead of the plague back in
the forest, and he was ragged and starved, and the
first person he met was a little girl, just as Peter met
Mona, and afterward he fought for her, and married
her when he grew old enough, and&mdash;she is Josette, my
wife. It is almost as if Peter was <i>me</i>. And I am
wondering&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish. But Simon nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"Things happen like that," he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out of the edge of the evergreen timber which ran
down to the white sands of Middle Finger Inlet
Mona was leading Peter. One of his eyes was entirely
closed. His lips were swollen and his face was grimy
and red with the marks of battle. He was a little
dizzy. There was a ringing in his ears, and with his
one good eye he could see the world but dimly. The
green forests were a blur. The sunlight was a mellow
glow. Mona's face, flaming with pride and joy, was an
ethereal vision of loveliness which he saw as if through
a number of gossamer veils. But in spite of his
wrecked appearance his heart was beating with a swift
and glorious exultation. He had kept his promise to
Mona, to Simon McQuarrie and to Pierre Gourdon,
for he had met and whipped Aleck Curry. The tug-master's
son had begged for mercy, and the riotous
thrill of it all was that Mona had looked upon that
splendid battle and the ignominious defeat of the overgrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
bully upon whose head she had earnestly prayed
calamity might fall.</p>

<p>Peter was fighting hard to maintain a calm and dignified
mental balance as they came out of the forest.
Mona's fingers clung to his hand. Her face was flushed
and her eyes were shining like lovely stars. But it was
the kiss he felt most of all&mdash;that warm and sweet and
amazingly unexpected tribute she had placed on his
lips in the moment of his triumph.</p>

<p>It was a new thing to Peter. Since his mother had
died he had never experienced anything like it and he
could only faintly remember his mother. Through the
years since then his father had kissed him every night
before he went to sleep. But Mona's kiss was different.
It remained with him in a strange and embarrassingly
persistent way.</p>

<p>"I knew you could do it," Mona was saying, a tremble
of pleasure in her voice. "I just knew it, Peter!
Does your eye hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"Can you see?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good."</p>

<p>She drew in a breath of deep and sincere appreciation.</p>

<p>"I got there just in time to see you bite Aleck's ear,"
she said. "Oh, how he did howl!"</p>

<p>Peter's conscience smote him.</p>

<p>"It ain't&mdash;I mean, it <i>isn't</i> fair to bite another fellow's
ear," he explained, "but he stuck it in my mouth
and I couldn't help it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you'd bit off his nose," said Mona. "If I
were a boy and had hold of his ear with teeth like
yours, I wouldn't let go."</p>

<p>A generous impulse filled Peter's breast. "I'll lick
him again tomorrow if you want me to," he offered.</p>

<p>They went up the green slope from the inlet. Peter
could hear better than he could see. He could hear the
soft croaking of the gulls and the singing of the birds
and the steely music of the saw in the mill. His bad
eye was toward Mona, so that unless he gave his head
a full turn he could not see her at all. A sweaty discomfort
possessed him whenever he believed she was
making a fresh survey of the disfigurements Aleck had
fastened upon him. With his triumph rode the humiliating
conviction that his face was out of joint and not
pleasant to look at.</p>

<p>"It'll be better tomorrow," he said.</p>

<p>"What will?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My face. It must look sort of funny."</p>

<p>"Not half as funny as Aleck Curry's," she comforted
him. "And if anyone dares to laugh at you&mdash;after
what happened out there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter caught the flash in her dark eyes. In spite of
his protest she pulled him through the open door of
Jame Clamart's cabin. Adette was bending over the
crib of young Telesphore. Her big blue eyes widened
and she gave a little gasp when she saw Peter, his hand
still held in Mona's.</p>

<p>And then, to his horror, she giggled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>In an instant Mona was at her side.</p>

<p>"Adette Clamart, don't you dare laugh!" she cried.
"If you had seen it! If you had seen him whip Aleck
Curry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But his eye!" exclaimed Adette chokingly. "I
mean <i>that</i> eye, Mona&mdash;the one that's open! It looks so&mdash;so
funny!"</p>

<p>"He's better-looking right now than Jame Clamart
will ever be," retorted Mona with fierce dignity. "He
hasn't got a snub nose, anyway&mdash;and that's what your
baby is going to have when he grows up!"</p>

<p>"But his <i>eye</i>!" persisted Adette, the giggling choking
her. "Why is it so round and glassy, Mona? It's
just like the end of my new glass salt shaker! Oh, oh,
<i>oh</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Adette Clamart!</i>"</p>

<p>Peter, stunned and speechless, watched Mona drag
Adette into the kitchen. As if drawn by an irresistible
magnet, his one eye followed them, and Adette&mdash;looking
back&mdash;gave a final little screech of laughter before
the door closed behind her.</p>

<p>Peter heard the tittering beyond that door, and
Mona's protesting voice rising above it. He felt as if
warm water had been poured down his back. He was
clammy, and his heart had sunk down into his middle.
He must be a terrible sight!</p>

<p>Then he saw young Telesphore looking at him over
the edge of the crib. In one of his fat fists the baby
clutched the knife which Peter had given him earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in the day. Peter went nearer and grinned at his
young friend. The effort hurt him. Telesphore's
mouth fell slowly ajar as he stared at Peter. He gave
no sign of recognition. The jovial comradeship of a
few hours ago was gone and his gaze was steady and
perplexed. And then, as if desirous of possessing
another strange article of interest, he dropped his knife
and reached for Peter's one eye.</p>

<p>Peter drew back. Adette was still laughing at him
and Telesphore did not recognize him! He remembered
a little mirror hanging on the wall and hurried
to it. He was shocked. The thrill of triumph left
him. His pride sank&mdash;and he sneaked through the
open door as quickly as he could and trotted toward
the big yellow piles of sawdust, hoping he might reach
them before Mona discovered his flight. Screened by
the piles, he came up behind Simon McQuarrie's cabin
and almost bumped into a little man with a great head
of shaggy gray hair, a round face with rosy cheeks,
and eyes that were at first amazed and then twinkled
merrily as they looked at Peter. He was a stranger.
But swiftly and instinctively Peter liked him. Something
in the way he rubbed his hands together and
chuckled built up a confidence and comradeship
between them immediately. Peter attempted a grin.</p>

<p>"I been in a fight," he acknowledged cheerfully, for
there was an attitude and quality about this little man
that demanded some kind of explanation. "I been in
a fight with Aleck Curry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he worsted you," guessed the merry stranger.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I beat him up. I made him howl, and he
promised never to bother Mona or her pets again.
Mona knows. She saw it."</p>

<p>The little man placed a hand on his shoulder. It was
a gentle hand. Its touch comforted Peter.</p>

<p>"Come in and let me fix you up, Peter. That is your
name, isn't it&mdash;Peter McRae?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>They went into the cabin. The little man seemed at
home in Simon's place, for he found the medicine cupboard
immediately, and was soon busy poulticing and
bandaging Peter's tortured face.</p>

<p>"Aleck is a troublesome boy," he said. "I hope you
punished him well. But he is so much larger than
you! Aren't you afraid of what may happen next
time?"</p>

<p>Peter shook his head. "I know how to do it now. I
run away from him until he's winded, then beat him
up. I'm going to lick him again tomorrow if Mona
wants me to."</p>

<p>"Good!" smiled the little man. His face grew rosier
and a light was in his eyes that pleased Peter. "But I
wouldn't try it on Sunday," he advised. "It's bad luck
to fight on the Lord's Day. If you'll wait until Monday,
I will take you out into the woods and show you
a few tricks that may help you! And if it can be
quietly arranged, Peter, I would like to see the next
fight you have with Aleck Curry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"You like fights?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"In a good cause&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Peter was thoughtful as his cheerful and comforting
companion fastened a bandage over his closed eye.</p>

<p>"Sunday isn't such a bad day for a fight," he argued.
"You could get Aleck Curry out in the woods somewhere,
tell 'im you wanted to show him something, an'
I could sneak up&mdash;an' we could have it right there. I
ain't&mdash;I mean I'm <i>not</i> afraid of Sunday!"</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking so much of you as I am of myself,"
said the little man, laughing softly. "I mustn't
let pleasure come before duty&mdash;on Sunday. You see,
I have to preach tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You have to&mdash;<i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Preach. Down there in the little church. I'm
Father Albanel, Peter."</p>

<p>For the second time in the last half-hour Peter's
earth seemed slipping unevenly under his feet. <i>Father
Albanel!</i> Mona had told him about the wonderful
forest missioner who had no church and no set religion,
but who wandered through hundreds of miles of
wilderness, preaching the faith of God wherever he
went, and who came every few weeks to Five Fingers.
"All the forest people love him, and he is so good I
think God must love him most of all," she had said.
"He buried my father and mother." And this was
Father Albanel&mdash;this little man with the jolly face and
twinkling eyes, and he&mdash;Peter McRae&mdash;had invited
him to witness a fight on Sunday! He squirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
uneasily. He could feel the hot blood rising up
through his neck into his face. He wet his swollen lips
and tried to save himself.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you was the preacher," he said. "I
guess mebbe it isn't right to fight on Sunday."</p>

<p>Father Albanel's hands pressed gently upon the boy's
thin shoulders. "It's right to fight any time, Peter&mdash;when
you have a just fight to make. God loves a peacemaker
but He also has no use for a coward&mdash;and no
one but a coward would refuse to fight for Mona.
Will you come and hear me tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"I'll come," promised Peter.</p>

<p>When Father Albanel had gone he climbed up the
ladder to his bed of blankets close under the sweet-smelling
cedar roof and undressed. The sun was low
in the west and the afternoon song of the mill had
ceased. The robins were chirping their evening notes.
It was supper time, and Simon McQuarrie was late.
Half an hour passed before Peter heard him enter the
cabin. He came directly to the ladder and climbed up.
In the twilight he bent over Peter.</p>

<p>"Feeling sick, Peter?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Simon knelt upon the edge of the blankets.</p>

<p>"I've heard about the fight," he said, in a voice
which trembled a little in its unaccustomed softness.
"Mona told me, and then Adette, and after that I went
down to the tug to have it out with Izaak Curry&mdash;and
his boy. But&mdash;Peter&mdash;lad, when I saw Aleck I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
no heart to speak harshly to his father. I'm proud of
you!"</p>

<p>In the silence he bent his face nearer to Peter's.</p>

<p>"Want something to eat, lad?"</p>

<p>"I can't eat," explained Peter huskily. "My mouth
is swollen shut."</p>

<p>It was then Simon McQuarrie's hard lips touched
Peter's cheek&mdash;the first kiss he had given in many
years.</p>

<p>"Good night," he whispered. "You're Donald
McRae's son&mdash;every inch of you!" And Peter listened
to his heavy feet as he slowly descended the ladder.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moon did not come up that night. Darkness
shut in the earth, and with it came a warm and
sullen stillness, broken only by low intonations of distant
thunder, advancing over the roofs of the forest.
A long time after Simon had gone Peter went to the
window and sat staring out into the gloom. The air
was drowsily heavy and bore with it the cooling breath
of rain. After a little a swift whispering ran through
the forest and the first gentle patter of raindrops fell on
the cabin roof. The thunder crashed nearer and vivid
flashes of lightning cut like flaming knives through
the blackness. In a moment, it seemed to Peter, the
storm broke in a deluge that set the log walls atremble.
It beat straight down, and did not come in at the window.
Peter did not stir. As long ago as he could
remember his father had taught him to be unafraid of
the awesomeness and beauty of thunder and lightning,
and many times they had watched a storm together
until the boy was thrilled by the significance and the
mystery of it.</p>

<p>It was his father he missed tonight, the immeasurable
thrill of his voice, his presence and his love.
Without reason his eyes strained questingly in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
brief moments when the lightning flashes filled the
world with a white radiance. In that light he could see
the mill, stark and vivid, like a skeleton illumined by
fire, the trees, the cabins, the stub in which the flying
squirrels lived, and the edge of the forest. He did not
miss that half of his vision which he had lost in his
fight with Aleck Curry; he had forgotten the fight, and
even Mona Guyon. For a time his thoughts were alone
with his father, and with his yearning and his loneliness
an unreasonable hope filled his soul&mdash;the hope
that his father would keep his promise and that out in
the glare of the lightning he would see him coming
from the forest into the clearing. His heart ached for
that. He did not know it, but under his breath he was
sobbing a little.</p>

<p>It was the truth, forcing itself upon him, the sullen,
terrible truth, driving him back from the window and
sending him creeping to his blankets, where he lay
huddled and still. He had never hated anyone, not even
Aleck Curry. But he was beginning to hate somebody&mdash;something&mdash;now.
He hated the men who were after
his father, and he was beginning vaguely to hate that
controlling force which both his father and Simon
McQuarrie had told him was the law. If his father
had only taken him! If they were only together now,
away out there in the forest, under a log or snuggled
in the shelter of an overturned root&mdash;anywhere&mdash;just
so they were together!</p>

<p>Why had his father lied to him, promising him he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
would come back in a day or two? Why had he sent
him on alone to Five Fingers? Peter choked back the
sob in his throat. <i>He knew.</i> It was because his father
loved him&mdash;because he knew that he could never return,
and wanted him to have a home with Simon
McQuarrie.</p>

<p>Burying his face in his arm, Peter gave up to his
grief. It was a silent, choking grief that ate into his
heart but brought no cry to his lips.</p>

<p>The thunder and lightning passed and the rain settled
into a steady patter on the roof. It was like
hundreds of gentle fingers tapping within a few feet of
Peter's head. It comforted him in his aloneness and
his grief. Mona was listening to that same friendly
patter on the cedar shingles. Tomorrow he would see
her again, and his heart grew warm. A part of her
seemed to come into the darkness of his room, and he
could see her eyes shining and feel the touch of her
hand&mdash;and the kiss. And afterward he fell asleep,
stirred by the strange and comforting sensation that
Mona was near him.</p>

<p>But in sleep he lost her. He dreamed that he was
trying to steal away from Five Fingers to go in search
of his father, but again and again Simon McQuarrie
caught him and brought him back. At last success
came. It was night, and he was crawling out through
his window into the moonlight, with a pack on his back.
He jumped to the ground and made for the woods.
And then a strange thing happened. Where his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had left him he found footprints on the earth. They
were very clear, and shining, as if made of bright silver,
and they reached a long distance ahead of him
through the forest. It puzzled him that his own
feet left no trail at all while his father's trail was
so clear.</p>

<p>Days and nights seemed to pass as he followed persistently
this silvery trail. Then he came to a wonderful
forest where the trees were so tall their tops seemed
lost against the sky. He walked on flowers. Great
masses of purple violets crushed under his feet, roses
filled the air with sweetness, wild geraniums nodded
and bowed to him, and crimson splashes of fire-flowers
carpeted long aisles and broad chambers of this
mysterious paradise.</p>

<p>He came at last to a waterfall. It did not roar, like
waterfalls he had known, but fell with a rippling song.
Near the waterfall was a cabin, and straight to the door
of the cabin led the silvery trail! Peter followed it.
He opened the door and went in and his father was
there. He turned to greet Peter and did not seem
surprised. His face was smiling and happy, and tender
with the old cheer and the old love.</p>

<p>"<i>I thought you would come soon, Peter," he said.
"I've been waiting for you.</i>"</p>

<p>It was then Peter awakened. The patter of rain on
the roof had ceased. The night had cleared and was
filled with stars, and a sweet warmth came in through
the open window. His dream had been overwhelmingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
real, and it left him with his heart beating
strangely. He did not sleep again but lay awake until
the stars began to fade in the gray light of dawn. Then
he dressed himself, making no sound that might disturb
Simon. When he looked down from his window he
almost expected to see the marks he had made in his
dream-leap. And it could be done&mdash;that jump! He
crept out backward, lowered himself full length from
the windowsill and dropped easily to the rain-softened
earth.</p>

<p>He went toward the stream which came down from
the timbered hills and ridges. The birds were beginning
to sing, the robins first, twittering their sweetest
of all songs, with eyes half closed. It grew gently,
each soft note increasing in strength until the invisible
chorus filled the clearing with its welcome to the day.
A thrush joined in. Bright-winged bluebirds flew
ahead of him, and sweet-voiced brush sparrows cheeped
and fluttered in their coverts, waiting for the sun.
Even the water dripping from the trees held in its
sound the cadence of whispered song.</p>

<p>And as if this melody held a spell which they were
powerless to combat, or which inspired them to silence,
the raucous jays were still and aloof, the whisky jacks
waited in fluffy brown balls, a cock-of-the-wood clung
to the side of a tree, his plumed head and powerful bill
making no sound upon the wood, and ahead of Peter
a gray owl retreated to a deeper and darker hiding-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The forest was a cathedral, and its symphony seized
upon Peter's soul and lifted it on a great wave of
anticipation and hope.</p>

<p>His father was listening to the birds, too. He was
waiting for the sunrise. And a stirring thought came
to Peter. If his father did not return, he would do
what he had done in his dream&mdash;go in search of him.
He was sure he could find him.</p>

<p>He undressed at the edge of a pool in which the
water was warm enough for a swim, and came out of
it a little later shivering&mdash;but still thinking. The early
rays of the sun were breaking over the tree-tops when
he returned to the clearing. His bad eye was half open
and most of the swelling was gone from his lips.
Simon was getting breakfast and was surprised that
Peter should come through the door instead of down
the ladder.</p>

<p>During the next hour his shrewd eyes saw a change
in the boy. Peter was restless and asked questions.
Where would his father be likely to go? Had he said
anything about it in his letter to Simon?</p>

<p>The Scotchman shook his head, guessing a little of
what was in Peter's mind. He explained the vastness
of the forests. They reached a thousand miles north and
twice that far east and west, and one might lose himself
in them all his life. Their bigness did not discourage
Peter.</p>

<p>"I think I can find my father," he said. "If he
doesn't come back I'm going to try."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought gripped him more tenaciously as the
early hours of the morning passed. Simon brushed and
mended him, and said he should have new clothes as
quickly as they could be brought from the settlement
on the railroad, and he talked of Aleck's defeat, and
of Mona, and of the wonderful beaver colony two miles
away, but the new thrill in Peter's blood swept over
all other things that might have interested him.</p>

<p>He would not tell Simon, but he was going in
search of his father&mdash;soon. It might be that night, or
the next, if he could get things together for a pack.</p>

<p>The sun was well up when he saw Mona come out
of the Gourdon cabin, and he went across the clearing
to meet her. He was a little upset, for he would have to
apologize for running away from her in such a boorish
fashion yesterday. Mona's appearance this morning
set his heart aflutter. She seemed almost as old as
Adette Clamart, and not at all like the little fighting
comrade who had helped him whip Aleck Curry at their
first meeting. She was dressed in spotless white, and
her long hair rippled and shone in the sun, and her dark
eyes were so beautiful that for a moment or two Peter
could find nothing to say as she looked at him.</p>

<p>Mona was not entirely unconscious of her disconcerting
loveliness, and her eyes shone and the color
grew prettier in her cheeks when she saw its effect on
Peter.</p>

<p>"This is my Sunday dress," she said, helping
him out of his embarrassment. "Do you like it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter shifted, and thought quickly. "You look like a
snowbird, one of the kind with a black topknot," he
complimented her. "What do you think of <i>me</i>?" And
he turned so that she could see where Simon had
mended his rusty clothes.</p>

<p>The sparkle died out of Mona's eyes, and in the
moment when his back was toward her Peter did not
see the look of pity and tenderness that took its place,
and with it a shadow of something else, as if he had
hurt her.</p>

<p>"I put on this dress for you. That's what I think
of you, Peter."</p>

<p>"I got better clothes," he explained, "but we came
away so fast we didn't have time to bring them."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't. I like you the way you are.
Do you like me, Peter&mdash;really?"</p>

<p>"A lot."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>Peter turned over various terms of measurement in
his mind. "Next to my father," he said.</p>

<p>"Then why did you run away from me when I
was in the kitchen with Adette Clamart?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Peter flushed. "I dunno. Guess I didn't like to be
laughed at. And the baby&mdash;he didn't know who I
was."</p>

<p>The soft notes of a bell tolled over the clearing, and
Peter drew himself erect and breathed a little tensely as
he listened to it. "I used to hear a church bell like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that, a long time ago," he said, softly. "I can just remember
it."</p>

<p>She touched his arm as they listened. "I was coming
to take you to church. Father Albanel says you
promised."</p>

<p>She started down the slope, walking slowly, with
Peter at her side. He thought it was interesting how
the sound of the bell suddenly opened the doors of Five
Fingers.</p>

<p>Pierre Gourdon came out of his cabin with his wife,
and Josette was dressed in white, like Mona; and Marie
Antoinette, waiting with Joe and their two children
to greet them, looked like a slim white angel to
Peter. Even Geertruda Poulin, who was almost as
wide as she was high, wore a dress as white as the
gull's wings down in Middle Finger Inlet.</p>

<p>The children were prim and starched and the men
were in clothes which Peter had not seen them wear
before, their faces shining with the effect of lather and
sharp razors.</p>

<p>And loveliest of all the girls and women, Peter
thought, was Mona&mdash;lovelier even than Adette Clamart,
who came hurrying to them with laughing
eyes and red lips and rebellious curls dancing about her
pink cheeks to beg Peter's pardon for laughing at him
the preceding afternoon.</p>

<p>To Peter's infinite dismay Adette seized his head between
her two small hands and kissed him squarely on
the eye which had looked so funny to her yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, I'm sorry, Peter," she said. "But you did
look so funny."</p>

<p>She was gone like one of the dainty, golden canaries
that nested in the clearing, running to catch up with
Jame, her husband, who had Telesphore in his arms.</p>

<p>Fire leaped into Mona's cheeks.</p>

<p>"I won't have Adette Clamart doing that," she
protested indignantly. "If your eye needs kissing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter was wiping it with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"That's right, wipe it away," she encouraged spitefully.
"I hate her!"</p>

<p>Peter said nothing. But he saw Mona's lovely eyes
flash in Adette's direction when they were seated on one
of the wooden benches in the little church. Adette
smiled mischievously and nodded her head, but Mona
made no response except to tilt her pretty chin a little
higher in the air and look straight ahead of her to the
platform where Father Albanel was ready to begin the
service.</p>

<p>The little missioner's face was even rosier and jollier
than yesterday, it seemed to Peter, and he was smiling
and nodding and rubbing his hands as if this particular
hour was the happiest of his life.</p>

<p>Peter, looking secretly about him, was impressed by
the fact that this was unlike any other Sunday meeting
he had ever attended. He missed the serious and
almost awesome solemnity of the other similar occasions
he could remember. Here everyone was free and
easy and refreshingly happy. Even Simon McQuarrie's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
emotionless face was more gentle, and he smiled
when he saw Peter, and a ripple of laughter ran easily
through the gathering when young Telesphore crowed
delightedly and waved his arms in an embracing greeting
to all about him. Then came the tinkle of a bell,
and suddenly the room was very quiet.</p>

<p>What happened after that was like a dream to Peter,
and it seemed constantly to be awakening something
new and happier within him. He had never heard singing
like that which filled the little church. Mona's voice
was clear and soft as the crested warbler's song which
he loved; and when she looked at him and whispered,
"Sing, Peter," his courage came to him, and a little
at a time he lifted his voice until his boyish tenor rose
clearly at her side. When they sat down she was nearer
to him, so near that her wonderful white dress
crumpled close against him and a tress of her shining
hair fell upon his hand.</p>

<p>"I love your singing, Peter," she whispered to him
again.</p>

<p>His heart beat fast and his hand twitched nervously
under the silken caress of her hair. Until now&mdash;this
hour when they sat so close together in the church&mdash;he
had not felt the deeper stir of that emotion which was
growing in him. Surreptitiously his fingers closed
about the soft tress of hair. Mona did not know it,
no one knew it but himself, and he looked straight
ahead while his heart beat still faster and the warm
thrill of his secret sent the blood into his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Albanel was talking. And in a trance Peter
listened. What struck him, and what he remembered
so clearly afterward, was the way in which the little
missioner talked about all living things, as if the
flowers and trees had hearts and souls, and God loved
the forests and all wild things just as much as He loved
people. Peter had heard his father say many of those
same things, only in a different way&mdash;for Father
Albanel's voice was like deep music that reached down
into the soul, and there was no whisper or stir among
those who listened to him.</p>

<p>He seemed to be looking straight at Peter when he
talked about Faith, and what faith meant in the lives
of men and women and children; and to make this clear
to the children of Five Fingers he told the legend of
Nepise, the beautiful Indian maiden, who was known
as the Torch-Bearer. It seemed to Peter the missioner
was describing Mona, for Nepise was the loveliest girl
among all her people, with eyes that were pools of
beauty and hair that fell about her like a shining black
garment. The story became a tragic and living thing
to him; he saw the plague-stricken Indian people, and
when Nepise died the effect upon him was like a shock.
But she had made her dying people a promise&mdash;a wonderful
promise!&mdash;to come back in spirit, bearing with
her the Torch of Life, and with this flaming torch she
would go from tepee to tepee and from village to
village, and all who had faith in her would see her and
to them would come health and happiness. And Nepise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
kept her promise, and forever after that, and up to this
very day, the Indian maiden was known throughout the
wilderness as the Torch-Bearer.</p>

<p>When Father Albanel had finished Peter looked at
Mona. Her red lips were parted, her eyes were aglow,
and in her white throat a little heart seemed beating.
And when they stood up again to sing his fingers still
held the soft tress of hair, and this time Mona saw it,
and smiled at him, and Peter was no longer afraid of
his secret.</p>

<p>After Father Albanel's benediction Mona led Peter
a little hurriedly from the meeting-house, but without
losing her prim dignity so long as she thought Adette
Clamart's eyes might be upon her.</p>

<p>"I shan't speak to her all day!" she confided in Peter.</p>

<p>They passed near the tug and saw Aleck Curry fishing
from the stern, and Mona told him that neither
Aleck nor his father ever came to church. Then they
came to a narrow foot trail that was new to Peter and
for half an hour walked slowly out on a green-timbered
point of land until they reached the big lake. It was the
finest view Peter had ever had of Superior. The great
sea seemed to engulf the world, and away out there
were three white dots which were ships under canvas.
It was warm and calm, and he was puzzled by a sullen,
booming roar until Mona led the way down a break in
the cliff and showed him the Pit, where the surf and
undertows boiled and rumbled even in fair weather.
And in storm&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>She tried to tell him what it was then, when the great
rocks were like so many monsters, grinding things to
pieces, and when nothing that lived could exist for
more than a minute or two in what Pierre Gourdon
called the maelstroms. They found a clean white rock,
worn smooth by the water, and sat down, and Peter
wondered at the change which came into Mona's face.</p>

<p>"Can you remember your mother, Peter?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and then said, "I've
seen her a good many times when I was asleep."</p>

<p>"Do you still see her?"</p>

<p>"I did two nights ago."</p>

<p>"Is she pretty?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So is mine." She folded her hands in her lap and
added quietly: "Out there is where my mother and
father were drowned. Uncle Pierre tied me to his back
and brought me ashore."</p>

<p>Then she told him the story of the wreck of the
sailing ship, and how Aunt Josette and Marie Antoinette
and Father Albanel and all the people of Five
Fingers said it was a miracle that even one should come
ashore alive. And she was that one.</p>

<p>"Father Albanel sometimes comes down here with
me," she said. "I love him. He always tells me about
Nepise. Isn't that a pretty name, Peter? It means
Willow Bud. But after she died and her spirit
came back with the torch they called her Suskuwao,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which means the Torch-Bearer. I love her, too. Do
you?"</p>

<p>Peter nodded. "I was thinking of you," he said
desperately, trying to get the choking thought out of
him. "Father Albanel was looking at you when he told
about the Indian girl. That's what you've been to me
since I come&mdash;a&mdash;a sort of torch-bearer, like he said she
was. I dunno what I'd have done if it hadn't been for
you."</p>

<p>It was out, and for a moment or two the suffocating
realization of what he had said made it difficult for him
to breathe easily. Mona did not look at him. Her
shining eyes were fixed steadily upon the vastness of
the lake.</p>

<p>"Was that why you touched my hair, Peter?"</p>

<p>"I guess so."</p>

<p>"You like me&mdash;<i>like that</i>?"</p>

<p>He nodded again, finding the moment too tremendous
for words. And this time Mona was looking at
him. There was an earnestness in her face which
made her seem older to Peter. Her eyes were a
woman's eyes, calm and steady in their gaze, as they
studied him for a moment.</p>

<p>"And I like you, Peter," she said then, "I like you so
much&mdash;that I never want you to go away from Five
Fingers."</p>

<p>"And I never want to go," he said. "Not if my
father comes back."</p>

<p>"He will come!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Her voice was quick and sure and filled with a
vibrant ring that sent a little tremble through him.
She was sitting very straight, and a gust of wind
stirred her hair so that it rippled and floated about her,
and Peter&mdash;looking at her with wide eyes and swiftly
beating heart&mdash;thought of Father Albanel, and of
Nepise the Torch-Bearer, and the beautiful faith the
little missioner had visioned entered into him and he
believed. And the strange and thrilling impulse came
to him to put his hand to that soft cloud of Mona's hair
and tell her that he believed. But he did not move, nor
did he speak. For a space Mona seemed to be far
away from him, gazing at something which he could
not see out beyond the turmoil of the Pit. Her fingers
were interlocked in her lap, and not until the voice of
Jame Clamart hallooed down from the top of the cliff
was the spell of silence broken.</p>

<p>Mona started but did not look up. She knew Adette
was there, smiling down at them and ready to wave her
hand. Quite calmly she said to Peter:</p>

<p>"It's that Adette Clamart. Will you promise never
to let her kiss you again?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;I promise," said Peter.</p>

<p>"As long as you live?"</p>

<p>"As long as I live."</p>

<p>"Cross your heart, Peter!"</p>

<p>Devoutly Peter took the solemn oath.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," said Mona. "I don't like kissing&mdash;but if
it has to be done I'll do it!" And a fiery little note in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
her voice was so combatively possessive that Peter suddenly
felt himself a helpless but willing slave in chains.</p>

<p>And in the days and weeks that followed his first
Sunday in the settlement this bondage was stronger
than the hungering loneliness for his father which
pulled him at times toward the big forests of the north.
Mona's world became his world. He began to fit into
its play, its duties, and the family communism of its
environment. He went to school. At odd hours he
worked about the mill and helped in the spring planting,
and later in the tilling of the soil.</p>

<p>In the passing of the summer Mona and Peter spent
much of their time together in the cool depths of the
forests. On these adventurings they were inseparable,
and their favorite haunt, specially on Sunday afternoons,
was a beaver colony a mile and a half up the
shore of the lake and a little back in the rough ridges
and hills. The beaver settlement was Mona's own
property, and it was one of the laws of Five Fingers
that no one should despoil it with trap or gun. It was
five years ago, Mona told Peter, that four old beavers
emigrated from some one of the colonies back in the
hills and she and Pierre discovered them building a
dam at this place. There were now over thirty of
them. A long time ago they had ceased to be afraid of
her, and some of them were so friendly she could touch
them with her hand. But they were alarmed when
Peter came with her and for days scarcely a head would
show when he was about. Very slowly and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
extreme caution they began to accept him as a part of
Mona, and the first cool breath of autumn was in the
nights before they would openly disclose themselves or
play on their slides or proceed with the varied duties of
their lives when he was watching the big dark pool in
which they had built their homes.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> September a sinister and foreboding gloom
seemed to creep out of the wilderness surrounding
Five Fingers.</p>

<p>The golden autumn, with its soft Indian summer and
its radiance of color, died almost before it was born.
The birch leaves did not turn yellow and gold but
stopped at a rusty brown; the poplar leaves curled up
and began to fall from their stems before the first
frost; mountain ash berries were pink instead of red,
and heavy fogs settled like wet blankets between the
ridges, while in the swamps the rabbits were dying in
hundreds and thousands of the mysterious "seven
years' sickness."</p>

<p>The men at Five Fingers, and especially Pierre
Gourdon and Dominique Beauvais, who read the
wilderness as if it were a book, regarded these matters
with anxious eyes. It was Pierre who called attention
to the going of the bluebirds a month before their
time, and noted first that the red squirrels were gathering
great stores of cones, and that the robins were
restless and uneasy and were assembling in the flocks
which presaged sudden flight.</p>

<p>Then, one sunset, a great flock of wild geese went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
honking south. They were high and flying very fast.</p>

<p>Pierre Gourdon pointed up. "When the wild geese
race like that in September&mdash;it means a bad winter.
Only twice have I seen it. The last time was two years
before we came to Five Fingers&mdash;a year of starvation
and plague; and the other time&mdash;&mdash;" He shuddered,
and shrugged his shoulders, for that other time was
in boyhood, when his mother and father had died back
in the forests, and he had dragged himself starving and
nearly dead to Ste. Anne de Beaupré.</p>

<p>Colder nights came, filled with moaning winds, and
the days were darkened by ash-gray skies through
which the sun seldom shone warmly, and more and
more frequently came the honk of geese racing south.
Peter could hear them at night, in darkness and when
the stars were shining, coming from the north, crying
down their solemn notes of passage from the high trails
of the air.</p>

<p>And these same nights he heard the wolves howl back
in the hollows and ridges and deeper hunting grounds
of the forests, and Pierre Gourdon listened uneasily to
the cold, hard note in their voices, and said to
Dominique:</p>

<p>"The wolves will run lean this winter, and
when hunger trails the wolves, famine is not far behind."</p>

<p>But it was the dying of the rabbits more than the
crying of the wolves that worried them at first. The
plague-stricken animals were lying everywhere, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
up to the steps of the cabins, and one day Peter counted
so many in a corner of the swamp that Simon
McQuarrie's eyes widened a little with doubt when he
told his story. Once every seven or nine years had the
rabbit plague swept on its devastating way through
the wilderness, but never had Pierre or Dominique or
Simon seen it so destructive as this year, and the nearer
howling of the wolves and the strange, clammy nights
with their deathlike fogs roused in Pierre Gourdon's
heart the ghosts of old superstitions and old fears put
there in tragic days when he was a boy.</p>

<p>And then came a night when the world seemed filled
with wet smoke, and on that night the gray Canada
geese came down from the north in a multitude so great
that they filled the sky over Five Fingers with a winged
deluge, and thousands of them dropped into the inlet
and the clearing to rest. Their honking was a bedlam
which made sleep impossible, and with the dawn Peter
could see them darkening the fields and the water of
Middle Finger Inlet. When the various companies and
regiments began taking wing the sound they made was
a steady thunder that sent a weird and thrilling shudder
through earth and air. There were ten thousand pair
of wings in that southward moving host, Pierre
Gourdon said. Peter had never thought there were so
many wild geese in the world and it puzzled him that
not one of them was killed by the men at Five
Fingers.</p>

<p>"A wild goose mates but once," Pierre explained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
"If his mate dies, he does not take another, but lives
alone for the rest of his life. Memory and loyalty like
that men do not have, and so it is a crime to kill them."
Then he added, looking up thoughtfully at one of the
winged triangles racing through the sky, "And the gray
goose lives a hundred years!"</p>

<p>In October what were left of the big snowshoe
rabbits began to turn white, and the wind kept steadily
in the north. Snow fell early. All through November
the big lake was lashed by fierce gales; the Pit roared
and whipped itself into furies, and the gulls were gone
entirely from Middle Finger Inlet. In a single night,
it seemed to Peter, winter came. And from the beginning
it was a black, ominous winter. For days at a
time there was no sun. The sky was shut in by a gray
canopy of cloud. When snow fell it was hard and biting,
and riding with the wind, it stung the flesh like fine
shot.</p>

<p>In December came a change. The winds died, the
skies cleared a little, and day and night it snowed until
the wilderness was smothered and the evergreen forests
bent to the snapping point under their burden. Trails
were closed and the hollows between ridges were filled.
One day Poleon Dufresne snowshoed in from the railroad
settlement, half dead from exhaustion and bearing
the news that all the world was shut out by snow,
and that it lay twenty feet deep in the open places. And
quietly he gave other news to Pierre Gourdon and
Dominique and Simon McQuarrie. The dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
plague of the wilderness&mdash;the smallpox&mdash;had already
begun to stalk through the northland.</p>

<p>Following the deep snows came a cold so intense that
the men no longer ran the hazard of frosted lungs by
working in the woods, and all wild life seemed to have
become extinct. Between the lake and the settlements
along the line of steel one could scarcely have found
the trail of a cloven hoof, for the deer and moose were
yarded deep and struggled breast-high against snow
for the bush-browsing that kept them alive, while the
caribou, milling against wind and storm, had left the
snow-smothered country for feeding grounds farther
north. It was a winter that began&mdash;first of all&mdash;with
starvation. The icy coating of the trees left no budding
for the grouse; small creatures smothered in thousands
under the hardening snow crust which could soon bear
the weight of a man; foxes and ermine gnawed bark in
their hunger; with the rabbits gone, owls died of a sickness
which ravages them in times of forest famine&mdash;and
the empty stomachs of wolves brought them nearer
and nearer to the clearing until frightened horses
broke halters in their stalls and cattle bellowed in their
terror.</p>

<p>Peter had never heard wolves as they cried out now.
Sometimes their wail of hunger was almost a sobbing
in the night, and again it was bitter and vengeful as
hoof and horn beat them back from some yarded
stronghold of moose and deer.</p>

<p>Each day and week Peter came to understand more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the tragedy through which he was passing. It was
one of the "black years." Father Albanel came to the
settlement early in January; he was thin and haggard,
his eyes deep-set, the rosy color gone from his face. In
the little church he asked the people of Five Fingers to
offer up prayer for the thousands who were sick and
the hundreds who were dying through all the great
wilderness from Hudson Bay to the Athabasca and
from Big Lake to the Barren Lands. Over all that
country the plague was raging, sweeping like a forest
fire from tepee to cabin, until in certain far places the
great Hudson Bay Company could no longer bury its
dead, and masterless dogs ran with the wild things in
the forests. Pierre Gourdon's face was almost as
haggard as Father Albanel's, and Mona called Peter's
attention to it, with a tense and strange look in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I overheard Uncle Pierre and Aunt Josette when
they were talking last night and they said they weren't
afraid for themselves but that they were afraid for
me," she said. "Why should they be, Peter? I don't
get sick easily."</p>

<p>"You're a girl, that's why," he explained.</p>

<p>"But if I should get sick&mdash;what would you do?
Would you dare to come and see me?"</p>

<p>"I'd come."</p>

<p>"Even if it was the plague?"</p>

<p>"I'd still come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to have you, Peter. If I was sick and you
didn't come, I think it would make me feel so badly I
wouldn't get well."</p>

<p>And that night, with the wolves wailing at its doors,
the blighting hand of the red plague fell upon Five
Fingers!</p>

<p>It touched Geertruda Poulin first, and Jeremie, her
husband, nailed a red cloth over his cabin door to keep
the children at a distance, and that rag, fluttering in
the winds, soon filled their hearts with a greater terror
than if they had seen a <i>loup-garou</i> haunting the edge
of the forest or the grim hunters of the <i>Chasse-galerie</i>
riding through the gloomy sky, for they were told that
to go near it meant death. And then, three days later,
little Tobina fell ill, and with a pale, brave face and
eyes in which there was no sign of fear Marie
Antoinette went into the plague-stricken cabin to nurse
them. After that Joe Gourdon's face was like a mask
carven out of stone until the night when Jame
Clamart pounded at his door and cried out the terrible
news that Adette was down with the fever. And that
midnight Josette calmly kissed Pierre and Mona good-by
and went to her. Until she was gone Pierre held
back the sob in his throat&mdash;then it escaped him, and he
held Mona close, so close that it hurt her. It was on a
Sunday morning, bitterly cold and filled with gusty
winds, that Jeremie Poulin staggered out from his door
and flung up his arms to the sky, and the word
passed from cabin to cabin that Geertruda was
dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Alone, barring all others from their company, Simon
McQuarrie and Father Albanel dug with picks and
grub-hoes the first new grave in the little cemetery.
Chunk by chunk they broke out the frozen earth, and
when it was dark&mdash;so dark no eyes could see them&mdash;they
helped Jeremie Poulin carry his dead over the
clearing and upon their knees prayed with him at the
grave-side. After that they lived in one of the barns,
visiting only the sick and the dead, and each morning
and evening Simon would shout to Peter through the
megaphone of his hands, asking him if he felt pain or
dizziness or fever, and warning him to stay in the
cabin. Then Sara Dufresne and two of her three children
were stricken and Jean Croisset died so suddenly
that the shock of it stopped every heart in Five Fingers.
Pounding of hammers came from the barn, and the
next morning there was another mound of brown and
frozen earth in the cemetery. A day later Dominique
Beauvais, with his house full of children, nailed up the
red badge of sickness over his cabin door.</p>

<p>Each day Peter saw Mona. They spent their hours
together, and Pierre Gourdon watched them as a hawk
watches its young. At night they sat at their windows,
for after Jean's death the skies cleared and a glorious
moon filled the world with light. And one night Peter
heard the hammers pounding again, and in the gray of
dawn&mdash;still sleepless and wide-eyed&mdash;he saw Father
Albanel and Simon and Jeremie Poulin come from
Dominique Beauvais's cabin bearing a long, grim thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
among them; and when they had reached the burial
slope he saw them turn back, and enter the cabin again,
and come forth once more with their shoulders bent
under a burden. Peter's heart choked him. He sobbed
and clutched his hands at his breast. It was Félipe and
Dominique, the two youngest of the Beauvais children,
whom he had seen carried to the burial plot.</p>

<p>Sobbing, he ran toward Mona's home. The door
opened and Pierre Gourdon came out. Peter stopped a
few paces away, for there was something in Pierre's
face that frightened him. At first he thought it must
be the madness of the fever; then his ears caught
words, strange, hard words that froze his blood and
that seemed to come with a mighty effort from Pierre's
ghastly face. Mona was sick! She was in bed&mdash;and
he must return to Simon McQuarrie's cabin and not
come again within breathing distance of the house!
Peter moved closer to the door, powerless to speak,
and Pierre thrust him back so roughly that he fell to
the ground.</p>

<p>"Go away!" he commanded, raising a hand as if to
strike the boy.</p>

<p>Through the open door Peter had a glimpse of
Josette's face looking out at him, so white and
haggard that for a moment he thought it was an
old woman's face. He cried out to her but in
the same moment she was gone and there came no
answer.</p>

<p>Then he spoke half defiantly to Pierre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to see Mona," he said. "I promised her I'd
come if she was sick."</p>

<p>"Go!" said Pierre again, pointing sternly toward
Simon McQuarrie's cabin. "You can come halfway
to learn how Mona is, but if you come this near again I
shall have you taken from Five Fingers!"</p>

<p>Peter drew slowly away, staring in horror at Pierre
and the cabin behind him. He slumped down on the
doorstep at Simon's place and did not feel the bitter
cold. He saw Pierre enter the cabin, and then he
watched the gray figures in the distant cemetery as
they moved slowly about, piling the last of the frozen
clods upon the burdens they had carried through the
dawn a few minutes before. And Mona was down
with that same sickness&mdash;which meant death!</p>

<p>In his torment he picked and twisted at his clothes
until his thin fingers were blue with the cold. Pierre
came out again and put up the red cloth, and then he
went to intercept the three men who were on their way
from the cemetery to their quarters in the barn. Father
Albanel and Simon McQuarrie returned with Pierre
and entered the cabin where Mona was sick. In a few
minutes Simon came out and seeing Peter huddled on
the doorstep, approached as near to him as he dared.
He asked the same questions, and gave the same warnings,
and assured Peter that Mona was only slightly ill,
and that she would get over it very quickly. But there
was in his face the same look that had been in Pierre's,
and Peter knew he was lying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is going to die," his heart kept crying, and
he dragged himself into the cabin and flung himself
upon Simon's bed, and when Joe Gourdon came in he
was crying, his head buried in his arms. With his
beloved Marie Antoinette keeping guard in Jeremie
Poulin's house of death, Joe was making a courageous
fight. "Tobina Poulin is past all danger, and if things
go well Aunt Marie Antoinette will come home in a
few days, and then you can come to us," he comforted
Peter. "Meanwhile I'm going to stay with you."</p>

<p>But Joe's cheerfulness was mostly forced. News
came early in the day that Adette Clamart was very
close to death, and that Jame and Father Albanel were
constantly at her bedside.</p>

<p>That night sheer exhaustion brought sleep to Peter.
He was awakened by a pounding at the door. Joe's
voice called out below and another answered it from
outside. It was Jame Clamart, going from cabin to
cabin in a madness of joy, telling the people of Five
Fingers that the crisis was over and Adette would live.</p>

<p>Peter could hear the running crunch of Jame's boots
in the hard snow as he hurried on to the next neighbor
and for a long time after that he lay awake in the cold
darkness of his room, thinking of Mona. Fear of
death had not gripped him so terribly before. In the
tragedy of others he had felt shock; its suddenness and
horror had stunned him and filled him with dread, but
the physical grief of it had not touched him deeply until
now. He was sick, but the sickness was in his heart, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
if something had been cut out of it, leaving in its place
an emptiness which made breath come to his lips in
smothered sobs. And that something which had been
taken away from him was Mona.</p>

<p>When he closed his eyes he could see her clearly on
her white bed, her long hair streaming about the pillow,
her face pinched and thin, and all the time she was
wondering <i>why he did not come</i>. She was going to
die; he could think of nothing but that, and after a little
one thing persisted in traveling through his brain so
frequently and so terribly that he called aloud for Joe.
The maddening picture was that of Father Albanel and
Simon and Jeremie Poulin marching through the gray
dawn to the burial plot with the bodies of Félipe and
Dominique Beauvais.</p>

<p>Joe came up, and for the rest of that night Peter lay
in the shelter of his arm and fell asleep again.</p>

<p>The next day came with good omen. A bright sun
rose over the forests, clearer and warmer than it had
been for many weeks. Herman Vogelaar, whose
laughter had gone with the death of his daughter,
Geertruda, came at breakfast time with the word that
Adette was entirely out of her fever, and that Poleon
Dufresne's wife and three children were much better
than yesterday. Father Albanel, he said, had spent the
last half of the night with Mona. Mona was very sick.
She was worse than Adette had been, or even Geertruda,
in the same length of time. He was afraid&mdash;&mdash;But
Joe gave him such a fierce scowl he did not finish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Peter saw the scowl and the nervous twisting
of Herman's fingers at the lapels of his coat as he tried
to think of something with which to cover his blunder.
He wanted to ask Herman to speak what had been on
his lips, but instead he put on his coat and cap and
heavy mittens and went out into the day, hoping that
somewhere he would see Father Albanel.</p>

<p>As if his hope were a prayer quickly answered,
Father Albanel came from the Gourdon cabin. The
little missioner advanced, keeping the wind well in his
face, and when he was fifty paces from Peter he
stopped and called to the boy to stand where he was.
Peter tried to speak bravely when he asked if Mona
was going to die.</p>

<p>"She is very sick," said the missioner. "We must
pray for her, and believe with all our might that she is
going to get well. I think God will let her live."</p>

<p>"I promised I'd come if she was sick. I got to keep
my word. I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>Father Albanel shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is impossible, Peter. There are too many of us
down now."</p>

<p>"I won't get sick," said Peter doggedly.</p>

<p>Father Albanel spoke sharply. "Keep to your cabin,
my boy, and be as brave as Jame Clamart has been. If
Mona grows worse, I will tell you."</p>

<p>Each morning after this he brought news of Mona to
Peter. For a week there seemed to be no change. On
the eighth day she was worse; on the tenth Pierre and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Josette and Father Albanel were fighting desperately to
save her life.</p>

<p>The tenth night came. It was past midnight when
Peter crept softly to his window and opened it. With as
little sound as he could make he drew himself through
and dropped to the ground. He ran away quickly, the
brilliance of the stars sending his shadow along with
him. He did not stop until he reached the Gourdon
cabin, and there he hugged closely against the log wall,
his heart beating wildly as he waited. Above him a
light glowed feebly against the curtain in Mona's room.
He wanted to call to her; he puckered his lips and
almost gave the whistling signal which she knew.
Then he heard a sound, a movement of some kind, and
stealthily he approached a lower window. He could
see Josette very clearly. She was seated in a chair
with her face bowed in her hands, and Pierre was
standing at her side, gently stroking her hair. Father
Albanel was behind them, his face white and torn
with grief. Then Peter saw that Josette was
crying.</p>

<p>A terrible fear gripped him as he drew away from
the window. What he had seen could mean only one
thing. Mona&mdash;<i>was gone</i>. He looked up at the dim
light above him again, and in that moment his soul
cried out against all those who had kept him away from
her. He went to the kitchen door, opened it, and
entered. This time he would scream and fight if they
tried to keep him back. But no one heard him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Father Albanel's voice came to him faintly. He was
praying.</p>

<p>Peter reached the stair and went up quietly. The
door of Mona's room was open. A lamp, turned low,
was burning on the table.</p>

<p>He approached the bed, scarcely knowing that he was
moving toward it. His heart was crushed, his world
crumbled and gone, for Mona must be dead or they
would not leave her like this, and Josette would not be
crying down below. Even his father could not have
helped him now. Nothing could help him, with Mona
<i>gone</i>. He stumbled to his knees beside her and his cold
fingers twined themselves about the soft braid of hair
that fell over the side of her bed.</p>

<p>A stifled, despairing sob broke from him then as he
stared at the thin face that lay so still and lifeless in the
pale light of the room. He had a great desire to touch
it but a moment of dread made him hesitate. Then his
hand crept slowly over the coverlet until it rested
against Mona's cheek, and the sobbing in his throat
was choked back, for the flesh he touched was hot. His
heart thumped until the sound of it seemed to fill the
room. Mona's eyes were opening! They were looking
at him! And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Two thin, white arms reached up and encircled
Peter's neck, and very faintly he heard his name whispered.
He pressed his face down close to Mona's.</p>

<p>"I'd have come sooner," he apologized, "but they
wouldn't let me in!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>And somehow, in that great moment of their lives
Peter's lips touched Mona's, and as the girl's flagging
spirit came at last in triumph back from the edge of
death Father Albanel entered the room; and when he
saw what had happened he spoke no word, but in silence
made the sign of the cross upon his breast and stood
with his gray head bowed in voiceless prayer.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was many minutes before Peter looked up and
saw Father Albanel standing at his side. The little
missioner made no movement except to place a hand
gently on the boy's head. Mona's eyes were wide open
and in them was a light of almost unearthly happiness
as she looked at Peter. In the pale lamp-glow it seemed
as though death had already possessed her, except for
those great, shining eyes out of which Father Albanel
saw all fever had gone.</p>

<p>In a voice that was low and choking he said, "You
must come away now, Peter&mdash;for a little while."</p>

<p>Mona's hands rose in weak protest to Peter's
shoulders, and he bent to meet them, pressing his face
down again without shame or embarrassment so that
her soft cheek lay close against his own.</p>

<p>Joy and gentleness fought with a gathering fear in
Father Albanel's face, and a little at a time, but firmly,
he drew Peter away, while between the words he was
speaking he breathed a prayer to Sainte Anne and the
Mother Mary asking that the boy might be spared the
curse of the deadly malady with which he had come
in contact.</p>

<p>At the door Peter turned, and Mona's eyes were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
strangely and darkly beautiful that he reached back his
arms to her with a little cry. "I'll come again, Mona!
I will! I'll come <i>soon</i>!"</p>

<p>They went down into the room where he had seen
Josette and Pierre, with his hand held tightly in the
little missioner's. He had never seen a face more terribly
white than Josette's, and Pierre was like a haggard
old man. He looked up at Father Albanel. The
missioner's face was streaming with tears, and through
the tears he was smiling. Then he began to speak. He
told how Peter had stolen into the house and had gone
to Mona.</p>

<p>"God sent him," he said. "He has done more than
all the physicians and medicines in the world could have
done, for he has brought Mona back from the very
gates of death. <i>She will live!</i>"</p>

<p>The last three words drowned all others for Peter.
His breath came in little jerks. Then he found himself
crying&mdash;in Josette's arms.</p>

<p>Josette pressed Peter to her and covered his pale, cold
face with kisses. Her great eyes seemed to drown him
with their nearness, and then she too was sobbing, with
his face hugged close to hers. It all passed in a very
few moments, it seemed to Peter, and Josette went with
Father Albanel to Mona's room. She came back in a
little while. Her eyes were shining and the whiteness
was gone from her face.</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;God has been good to us again," she
said, looking into Pierre's wildly questioning eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fever is broken. Her skin is soft and moist.
And&mdash;she&mdash;<i>wants Peter</i>!"</p>

<p>Josette and Pierre understood the look that came
into Father Albanel's face. They waited for him to
speak.</p>

<p>"Please let me go," begged Peter. "I won't make a
noise. I'll sit quiet."</p>

<p>Father Albanel swallowed a lump in his throat.</p>

<p>"And mebby&mdash;if I ask her&mdash;she'll go to sleep," urged
Peter.</p>

<p>The missioner nodded his gray head. "That's it,"
he said, looking first at Pierre and then at Josette. "I
think if Peter were there, she would sleep. The boy has
already been exposed. It cannot be worse. It is God's
will. Let him go and sit beside her."</p>

<p>A joyous thrill went through Peter. Father Albanel
turned to him and put his hands on the boy's
shoulders.</p>

<p>"You must tell her you can stay only if she
will try very hard to go to sleep. After that you
mustn't talk to her. And just as soon as she is asleep
you must slip away quietly and come back to
us here."</p>

<p>"I promise," said Peter.</p>

<p>Josette helped him off with his coat. Then she
kissed him, and Peter went softly up the stair.</p>

<p>Though he came with scarcely more sound than a
shadow to her door Mona heard him. Her eyes were
watching for him, so big and shining in her thin white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
face that to Peter she seemed all eyes. He did not
trouble with a stool or chair but knelt beside her bed.
Mona's hands went up to his face and their gentle touch
drew him down until she kissed him on the lips. There
was no hesitation in her act. It was as if she had
always kissed him.</p>

<p>"Please kiss me, Peter," she said.</p>

<p>He kissed her.</p>

<p>"I was dreaming that over and over," she smiled at
him faintly, "and you didn't come. Now it's true.
And&mdash;I'm&mdash;so&mdash;glad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk," he warned, remembering his
duty. "They said if <i>you</i> said anything after I told
you this I'd have to go downstairs. They want you to
sleep.</p>

<p>"An' I want you to <i>sleep</i>," he added courageously.
"You mustn't say another word&mdash;not one!"</p>

<p>Mona started to speak, then put a finger to her lips,
and her eyes glowed at Peter until he felt creeping
through him an overwhelming desire to kiss her again.
She tucked her hand in his, and he settled down, sitting
on the floor. Mona closed her eyes and gave a deep
sigh. Her fingers squeezed Peter's, and Peter's fingers
squeezed back.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Josette tiptoed up the stair.
Quietly she came through the dim light to the bedside.
Mona was asleep. She was breathing evenly for the
first time in many days. Peter had leaned over so that
his cheek was resting on the thick, soft braid of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hair. Mona's hand was still clasped in his. And he too
was asleep.</p>

<p>Josette drew back as quietly as she had entered and
returned to Pierre and Father Albanel.</p>

<p>Hours later Peter awoke. He thought he was
dreaming at first. Then he found his fingers buried in
Mona's braid, and saw her pale face against the pillow.
Everything returned to him in a moment, and he moved
his cramped legs an inch at a time, and very quietly got
on his feet. Mona was asleep. He bent over and
listened to her breathing. Then he looked at the little
clock that was ticking on a shelf above her table. It
was four o'clock. Almost time for the gloomy dawn
to come. He must have slept a long time! And Mona
had slept too. His heart beat joyously as he backed
slowly toward the door, careful not to make the
slightest sound.</p>

<p>In the room below he found Father Albanel sitting
with his gray head bowed over a book which had fallen
into his lap. But Josette heard him, still as he had been,
and came out of her room. She was in a white nightgown
with soft arms bare to her elbows and her hair
in two long, loosely plaited braids.</p>

<p>To Peter she was more than ever like an angel.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h-h!" she whispered, putting a finger to her
lips. "Everyone is asleep, Peter&mdash;except you and me!"</p>

<p>She took his hand and led him into the spare room
which had once been Joe's, and sat down with him for
a few moments on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are going to stay with us for a while," she
said in a voice so low and sweet that it was like music
to Peter. "Will you like that?"</p>

<p>He shook his head affirmatively. "I wanted to come
all the time. I promised Mona I would&mdash;if she was
ever sick."</p>

<p>Josette drew his head gently against her breast. He
could hear her heart beating.</p>

<p>"I am Mona's mother. After this&mdash;how would you
like me to be <i>your</i> mother?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd like it. But I gotta live with Simon. Dad
told me to&mdash;until he comes back."</p>

<p>The arm about his shoulders tightened a little.</p>

<p>"Yes, you must live with Simon. I wouldn't take
you from him. But I'm going to be your mother, Peter&mdash;just
the same. From now on, all the time, you belong
to me just as Mona does."</p>

<p>"I guess that's why Mona likes me&mdash;because I
haven't got a mother," he tried to explain. "But my
dad's coming back. He'll love you too. Nobody can
help loving you, can they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Peter."</p>

<p>"Simon says they can't. My mother was just like
you. I've dreamed of her lots of times."</p>

<p>"Does she look like me&mdash;in your dreams, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Last time I thought she <i>was</i> you. We were out in
the woods picking flowers, an' Mona was there.
Then she faded away. She always fades away, just
sort of melts until you can't see her&mdash;my mother, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
mean." Suddenly he asked, "Did you ever see Mona's
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter."</p>

<p>"Was she pretty?"</p>

<p>"All mothers are pretty, Peter."</p>

<p>Peter pondered for a moment. "I guess mebby they
are," he said, and then added a little dubiously, "except
now and then. I'll bet Aleck Curry's mother isn't
pretty!"</p>

<p>"To Aleck&mdash;she is beautiful," whispered Josette,
and drew herself gently away from him. "You
must undress and go to bed now, Peter. Good
night!"</p>

<p>For a while after she was gone he sat on the edge of
his bed wondering what she had meant in saying that
thing about Aleck Curry and his mother. A beast like
Aleck <i>couldn't</i> have a pretty mother. But her words
troubled him even after he was undressed and in bed.
If by any chance Aleck <i>did</i> have a pretty mother&mdash;why&mdash;it
wasn't right for Mona and him to hate Aleck as
they did, that was all!</p>

<p>He didn't sleep much between then and morning, and
when he came out of his room, just as the first cold
light of the winter sun was falling in the clearing,
happier faces greeted him. Mona was better. In the
reaction of joy that had swept over the household there
was once more laughter in the kitchen. Josette went
up the stair singing. And when at last she called down
for Peter he found Mona bolstered up in her bed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Josette was brushing her hair, which streamed about
her in long, beautiful cascades of silken softness.
Mona's eyes and face were different this morning. She
was more like the Mona he had known, only thinner
and whiter, and she smiled at him when he came
through the door.</p>

<p>With Josette so near, Peter was a little self-conscious
and clumsy in his greeting. But Mona held out her
arms, just as she had done last night, and pulled him
down to her, and kissed him.</p>

<p>From that day the great fact in the lives of the two
children was accepted in Five Fingers. Mona and
Peter belonged to each other. And so sure was Father
Albanel of God's intention in the matter that he felt no
worry about Peter, in spite of the fact that the boy
had come in fearfully close contact with the deadly
malady.</p>

<p>"He will not catch the sickness," he said confidently.
"God didn't send him for that."</p>

<p>And as day after day passed, and only good news
continued to come from the Gourdon cabin, those who
had at first doubted also came to believe; for Mona's
coming back from death, and Peter's escaping the
plague, were miracles like those which happened at
the precious shrine of Ste. Anne de Beaupré, and only
God could have brought them about.</p>

<p>In two weeks Mona was out of bed and on her feet.
And from that day, Peter noticed, she did not hold
out her arms to him again, or ask him to kiss her. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
her eyes were always soft and full of happiness when he
was near her.</p>

<p>The last of winter passed, and spring came. May
followed April, and flowers sprang up in the clearing.
The birds returned, work began in the fields, and in the
sweetness and promise of life Five Fingers rose out of
the grimness of its tragedy.</p>

<p>One warm day when they had gone to the big beaver
pond, just a week after Mona's fourteenth birthday,
Peter said something that he was <i>thinking</i>, and didn't
mean to say at all. He had been thinking it off and on
for a long time, and the words slipped out of him
before he knew it.</p>

<p>"You never ask me to kiss you any more," he said.</p>

<p>"Girls don't ask boys to kiss them&mdash;not unless they're
sick," replied Mona, looking at him with eyes so bright
that Peter felt every drop of blood in his body rushing
to his face.</p>

<p>"Then I&mdash;I sometimes wish you was sick again!"
blundered Peter.</p>

<p>"Peter!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he affirmed stubbornly.</p>

<p>Mona's cheeks were flushing until they were the color
of a rose.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes flashed and she stamped a little
foot.</p>

<p>"You don't want to kiss me <i>or you'd ask for it</i>!" she
cried. "I always had to make you!"</p>

<p>It was a new thought for Peter to ponder upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Half an hour later, when they were almost home, he
came to a decision.</p>

<p>"I do!" he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>"You do <i>what</i>?" asked Mona, who had been livelier
than ever in hunting for flowers.</p>

<p>"You know."</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"You can guess."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to guess."</p>

<p>"I'll give you three chances," offered Peter.</p>

<p>"I don't want them."</p>

<p>Peter was desperate. "You didn't mean what you
said, then?"</p>

<p>"What did I say?"</p>

<p>"You said I didn't want to kiss you or I'd ask for it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you haven't asked."</p>

<p>"I did. I just asked."</p>

<p>Mona's lovely eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>"Did you, Peter? I didn't hear it. Please ask
again!"</p>

<p>Peter gulped.</p>

<p>"Will you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Will I <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Let me kiss you?"</p>

<p>For what seemed at least an hour to Peter she stood
looking at him.</p>

<p>"If I do&mdash;will you promise never to kiss any other
girl?"</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"And never let any other girl kiss you? I mean
Adette Clamart, too!"</p>

<p>"Sure I do."</p>

<p>"As long as you live?"</p>

<p>"As long as I live."</p>

<p>With a little gesture of gladness and satisfaction
Mona Guyon held up the prettiest mouth in all Five
Fingers, and Peter kissed it.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the weeks and months following the plague at
Five Fingers Father Albanel did not forget his
promise to Peter, and back in the shelter of the woods,
where their secret was safe between them, he taught
the boy "how to fight like a gentleman&mdash;if he had to
fight at all." It was then Peter learned there was
something more helpful than brute strength, and as his
skill increased and he mastered one after another what
the little missioner called "the tricks of the fighting
game," his enthusiasm rose to a point where he could
scarcely keep his secret from Mona. Their boxing-gloves,
which Father Albanel had smuggled from the
settlement, they kept securely hidden, and not until
years later did Peter know that the holy man who was
teaching him had at one time been regarded by fighting
men as the handiest man with his fists between Fort
William and Hudson Bay.</p>

<p>What he had learned he did not fully realize until
early in June, when Aleck Curry and his father and
the hateful black tug returned to the settlement. Using
the influence of a brother who had been successful in
politics, Izaak Curry had obtained timber concessions
in several directions about Five Fingers, and now built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
himself a cabin near the shore, but hidden back in the
spruce. This he tenanted with a third brother and his
wife, and with them Aleck lived while the tug was
making its trips between Five Fingers and Fort
William.</p>

<p>Aleck had grown still bigger, and in spite of Peter's
resolution to make friends with him he would have
none of it. His hatred for Peter was like some deadly
thing that had poisoned every drop of blood in his
veins, and Mona's growing beauty, and her quite open
affection for his rival, stirred something that was more
than hatred&mdash;more than brooding vindictiveness&mdash;in
Aleck's heart. His father was rich, and he knew what
that meant back in town; and his uncle was a power in
politics, and had recently become Commissioner of
Provincial Police. It enraged him that these facts carried
no weight in Five Fingers. His own importance
as the son of a rich man and the nephew of a Commissioner
was utterly unrecognized here, while in town
it had given him a position of first rank in spite of his
bullying nature. This lack of appreciation, as he
thought of it, he laid entirely at Peter's door, for it was
Peter who had robbed him of his chances with Mona
in the first place, and it was Peter who was keeping
her away from him now.</p>

<p>So it was not long after Aleck's arrival before the
climax came. It happened well out of sight of everybody,
where Aleck had schemed that it should be, for
he wanted no interference in his "beating up" of Peter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
In the end both boys returned to the settlement with
bleeding noses and black eyes. Neither was whipped.
Aleck was dumbfounded. That his size and weight and
all the training he had given himself during the winter
had failed to beat Peter was unbelievable.</p>

<p>For two weeks after the fight there was not a day,
excepting Sundays, when Father Albanel and Peter
did not "take a walk" in the woods together. And
along with these secret sessions Peter took advantage
of every opportunity to run and swim that he might
add to his wind. Almost daily he accepted insults from
Aleck in order to avoid a fight, and never a day passed
that Father Albanel did not repeat his warning to
Peter to postpone further combat as long as possible.
But the time came when Aleck once more followed
up insult with physical action, with the result that he
suffered a defeat so completely decisive that in August
he returned to Fort William, fairly laughed out of Five
Fingers.</p>

<p>Mona now made up Peter's world, and in his heart
she kept constantly burning the faith that his father
would return. But when winter came again, and another
spring, and there was still no word from Donald
McRae, Peter came at times to believe that his father
was gone out of his life forever.</p>

<p>Aleck Curry again returned to Five Fingers in this
third summer of Peter's life there. He was nineteen
now, and was commissioned by his father to take an
interest in his lumber business along the coast. A year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had made a big change in him, and his hatred for Peter
and his passion for Mona he kept more to himself. His
father told Simon that in another year Aleck was going
to join the provincial police, and would soon hold a
commission in it....</p>

<p>Early in September, when Mona was in her sixteenth
year, the event against which Peter had been steeling
his heart for many months became a fact. Pierre and
Josette had long planned that after Marie Antoinette's
teaching in the little settlement school Mona should
spend a year, and possibly two, under the tutelage of
the Sisters in the Ursuline Convent in the city of
Quebec. On the day Mona left, accompanied by Joe's
wife, who went to see her safely settled in the distant
city, Peter's world went as black as on that other day
when his father disappeared out of his life.</p>

<p>The winter that followed was an endless one for
Peter. Once each week, as surely as the weeks came
round, he received a long letter from Mona, and five
times during the winter he made the trip to the railroad
settlement alone that he might not miss the love and
cheer which came from her. And he was at the train to
meet her, with Pierre and Josette and Marie Antoinette
and Joe, when she came from the school in June.</p>

<p>At first he was dazed by the change in her, she had
grown so much taller, and more beautiful, and he stood
as if turned into wood while she greeted and kissed all
the others. Then she turned to him, and her face was
flooded with a color which he had never seen in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
before. And after that&mdash;he could never remember how
it happened&mdash;their arms were around each other, and
Mona was crying&mdash;crying until tears blinded her&mdash;and
he was kissing her, and she was kissing him, and
then ran away from him to hug all the others again.</p>

<p>This summer in Five Fingers decided the lives of
Peter and Mona. She was almost seventeen. She
would go to school one more year, because that was
the desire of Josette and Marie Antoinette. She would
be nearly eighteen then. And when she was nineteen&mdash;on
her nineteenth birthday, if Peter liked it that way&mdash;she
would marry him.</p>

<p>During the second year of her absence Peter devoted
every energy of soul and body toward making himself
worthy of her. He worked and planned and studied
hard under Marie Antoinette and Father Albanel.
During this year several changes came to Five Fingers.
Simon McQuarrie ended his dealings with Izaak Curry,
and to rid their paradise of a bad memory Adette
Clamart deliberately set fire to the Curry shack after
he had gone, so that nothing remained but a square
of ash and charred timbers. "And the wild phlox will
cover that next summer," said Adette with a grim little
shrug of her pretty shoulders.</p>

<p>Aleck Curry joined the police. In a day and a night,
it seemed, he sprang into a great bulk of a man, heavy-faced,
huge-shouldered, a giant in strength and
physique, and with a hatred for Peter in his heart that
had grown more merciless with the passing of years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
He saw Mona each summer, and when she returned
from her second year at school her beauty stirred in
him a passion which submerged all other instincts and
desires. He became a watchful, waiting beast, hiding
the flame that was consuming him, preparing himself
for the opportunity which he was determined should
some day come his way.</p>

<p>As each week brought nearer the day of their own
supreme happiness Mona and Peter no longer sensed
this menace, or even thought of it, and because Aleck
was so utterly outside all the possibilities of her life the
deeper sentiment of womanhood growing in Mona compelled
her to treat him more kindly. Even Simon's
suspicions were dulled, for during the winter preceding
her nineteenth birthday Aleck visited the settlement
only twice. Another spring and summer followed.
The twelfth of the coming October was Mona's birthday.
On that day she would become Peter's wife. It
was planned that they should live with Pierre and Josette
until the good logging snows came, when all of
Five Fingers would join in building their home.</p>

<p>It was on a day in August that Mona set out alone
for the beaver pond, carrying a basket in which was her
own and Peter's supper. Peter, returning from a trip
up the shore, had promised to meet her before sundown
in their old trysting-place, where two winters before
he had built her a little "play-house" cabin.</p>

<p>And on this same afternoon, as Mona left the settlement,
a stranger was making his way toward it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>An attitude of unusual caution and a haunted way
of looking about him were the two things one would
have noticed first as he came out of a swamp into an
open forest of white pine. He drew in a deep breath
of the freer air, and with a gesture of relief wiped his
face with a hand that was rough and twisted and
scratched by contact with briers. He was oddly disheveled
and smeared with swamp oil. His gray head
with its grizzled and uncut hair wore no hat, his shirt
was in rags at the throat and sleeves and his trousers
were tucked into high boots which bore evidence of
having gone through mud and water to their tops.
Upon his shoulders he carried a pack, and though the
tenuity of its folds emphasized its lightness in weight,
the man freed himself from his burden with an audible
gasp of relief.</p>

<p>Then he leaned against a pine and looked back at
the swamp from which he had come, listening with
singular intentness for any sound which might strike
with warning or unusual import upon the languorous
stillness of the afternoon. His face was pallid under
its stubble of beard even after the heat and exertion
he had passed through; his cheeks were sunken as if by
sickness or hunger, and his lips were drawn and thin.
In his eyes seemed to lie all the strength that remained
in the man. They were furtive and questing as they
watched, missing no shadow that moved.</p>

<p>The sweetness of ripened summer, its lazy whisperings
and the stillness which comes in a deep wood when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the sun is overhead lay about him or trembled softly in
the air. For hours he had been in an oven of swamp
heat and winged pests; here it was cool. In the pine
tops a hundred and fifty feet above his head was a faint
stir of the breeze that came from Lake Superior. It
reached down and touched his hot cheeks. He could
taste the invigorating freshness of it, and there came
slowly a change in his restless eyes, a softening of the
tense lines about his mouth, a lighting up of his face
where before it had held only suspense and watchful
uncertainty. He picked up his shoulder pack, carrying
it in his hand as he turned away from the swamp.</p>

<p>The transformation in the man's face was strangely
at odds with the painful physical effort which accompanied
his tedious progress. He no longer looked behind
him but kept his eyes ahead, as if anticipating at
any moment the appearance of something of vital
importance toward which he was struggling with the
last bit of strength that remained in his body. When
at last he came to a little brook, gurgling between the
pine roots, he fell rather than knelt beside it, and drank
like one dying of thirst. Then again and again he
plunged his face into hands filled with cold water and
wet his head until his gray hair was dripping.</p>

<p>He followed the brook. Several times he stumbled
and fell in the rougher places and once his toe caught
a root and he plunged into the stream itself. At the
end of an hour he had traveled a mile. Then he came
to a knoll of hardwoods, crossed it and made his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
down through a lacework of yellow birch until he arrived
at the edge of a deep, still pond that began in
sunlight and lost itself in the almost cavernous coolness
and shadow of a spruce and cedar forest. Instinctively
the man knew it was a beaver pond, and
almost instantly he had proof it was alive. A warning
tail lashed the water with the sound of a paddle struck
sideways, and across the pool, a short stone's throw
away, an object moved through the water.</p>

<p>Dizzily the man sat down. His vision was clouded
so that it was difficult for him to see even the moving
object. He fell upon his side and stretched himself
out on a couch of thick green grass. In another moment
he was lying with his eyes closed but with ears
keenly alert. During the next half-hour he heard
every sound about him; then his pale eyelids closed
heavily and a weariness of brain and body which he
could no longer combat dulled his senses to a physical
and mental inertness which was almost sleep.</p>

<p>In this state of somnolence he had lain for possibly
a quarter of an hour when a sound reached his ears
which first opened his eyes and then brought him in
a quick and defensive movement to a posture that was
half sitting and half crouching.</p>

<p>The sound came again, and amazement replaced the
alarm in his face. What he heard was a feminine voice,
strangely soft and subdued in this place of coolness
and shadow and mysterious stillness. It was a note
of laughter, almost birdlike in its sweetness, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
man's fingers clutched at the breast of his ragged shirt
as he listened. Then he began to crawl slowly in the
direction of the sound, making his way through a
green thicket of willows, careful that no twig snapped
under his weight to give warning of his approach.
Suddenly he came upon a scene whose unexpectedness
was almost a shock to him.</p>

<p>He had reached the farther edge of the willows, and
before him was a little meadow not more than half an
acre in extent, green and filled with wild flowers. Almost
within reach of his hands was a mountain ash
weighted with ripening fruit, and under this tree, close
to the edge of the pool, a girl was seated on the grass,
partly facing him. His first glimpse of her was of a
bowed head crowned by a wealth of coiled hair; then,
as she looked up, he saw her face. Her cheeks were
flushed, her dark eyes shone, and as she laughed again
she snuggled her face close down over a furry thing
scrambling about in her lap. The man saw there were
two of these creatures&mdash;baby beavers. His eyes wandered
a little. At the edge of the pond, half out of the
water, was a full-grown beaver. And this older inhabitant
of the place was conscious of his presence in
the willow thicket!</p>

<p>The girl was talking and laughing with the little
ones, calling them by name. One was Telesphore and
the other Peterkin&mdash;and the man drew in his breath
with a gasp. He watched her tease them with a carrot.
One scrambled up and tangled a foot in her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peterkin!" she cried. "Peterkin&mdash;you little ruffian!"</p>

<p>The old beaver remained stolid and motionless, watching
the menace in the willows. A companion swam
lazily past, scented the danger and struck the water a
blow with his tail before he dived.</p>

<p>The girl looked up quickly and spoke to the old
beaver. "What is the matter, Peter?" she cried.
"Don't be foolish. Come and get your carrot!"</p>

<p>It was then she heard a little cry behind her, and
turned and saw the man's face in the willows.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mona Guyon</span> was not afraid. She was
startled, and thrilled by an instant intuitive
sensing of the unusual and the significant in the man's
unexpected appearance. Yet the color did not leave
her cheeks nor did a cry come to her lips. She thrust
the baby beavers from her lap and rose unexcitedly
to her feet, tall, slim and amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p>She was looking steadily at the man, and as she
looked her heart beat a little faster, for the wilderness
had taught her a quick and definite understanding of
the story she saw written in the wild face among the
willows. Its tragedy flashed upon her before her parted
lips had found words&mdash;hunger, sickness, the emaciation
and weakness of a man who found less discomfort
upon his hands and knees than upon his feet.</p>

<p>As she looked at him a change came into his face
that the man himself could feel as there swept over
him a slow and inundating sense of shame. Every instinct
of chivalry in him revolted at the ridiculous and
alarming figure he must be making of himself. But
even in this moment of surprise and distress he did
not entirely lose his sense of humor. He tried to smile.
The effort was nothing short of pathos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said as he rose a little unsteadily
to his feet and came out of the willows. His
raggedness and the coarse stubble on his face could
not conceal the consciousness of pride with which he
straightened himself and bowed to her. "I have come
upon you like a wolf, and I know I look like a wolf.
But I assure you I am as harmless as a sheep, and if
you don't mind dividing your carrots with me&mdash;&mdash;"
He nodded toward the little yellow pile of carrots she
had brought for her beaver pets.</p>

<p>His voice was pleasant. It made her think of Father
Albanel, and as he spoke a smile was in his eyes and
on his pale lips. She went quickly to his side and put
a hand on his arm. Its firm young touch seemed to
steady him.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she asked. "You look&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sick&mdash;and a little mad," he finished for her, when
she hesitated. "But I'm mostly hungry, and if I may
have the carrots&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She helped him to the foot of the tree and he dropped
down beside it with a weakness that made him hunch
his shoulders in disgust.</p>

<p>"I have something better than carrots," she said.
"Please sit here and I will get it."</p>

<p>She hurried across the little meadow to a deeper shade
of thick-growing jack pines on the farther side, and the
man turned his head to follow her movements with his
eyes. Her beauty was twisting at something in his
heart. A long time ago he had known someone like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
her. The slim figure, walking swiftly across the open,
took him back twenty years, and he could almost hear
a sweet voice calling his name, and in a place very much
like this, with the coolness of the wilderness all about
and the sun shining through the trees. His hand
touched the scrub of beard on his face and he shivered.
The thought came to him that the girl was afraid of
him and was running away. As she disappeared among
the banksians he reached for one of the raw carrots and
began to eat it.</p>

<p>Mona returned so quietly that he did not hear her
until she was at his side. She brought a basket and a
small pail of cold spring-water. She spread a napkin
on his lap and loaded it with the contents of the basket.
He was sensitively conscious of her eyes upon him
and he tried not to appear ravenous as he began with
meat and bread.</p>

<p>"I'm spoiling your picnic, child," he said, speaking
to her feebly like a man who was very old. "I'm
sorry."</p>

<p>"You're not spoiling it," she cried, leaning toward
him with a gesture full of sweet tenderness. "Oh, I
have been so happy today&mdash;God has made me happier
by bringing me here in time to help you!"</p>

<p>"Happy," he whispered, as if to himself. "It is wonderful
to be happy. I have known&mdash;what it is."</p>

<p>It was her struggle to appear natural now as he
ate. She had never been so intimately close to starvation
and pathos and weakness in man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you lost?" she asked.</p>

<p>He caught quickly at her suggestion. "Yes, lost&mdash;in
the woods and the swamps between the railroad and
here. I was trying to find a place called Five Fingers."</p>

<p>She gave a little exclamation. "I'm from Five Fingers.
It is not far. Uncle Pierre calls it a mile and a
half."</p>

<p>Mona wondered at the strange silence which came
over the man, and the suddenness with which his
hunger seemed to be satisfied.</p>

<p>"You have been an angel to me," he said, when he
had finished. "And&mdash;things love you. Even the wild
creatures." He was looking at the baby beavers,
humped into furry balls at the edge of the pond. "You
called one of them Peterkin, and the old beaver Peter.
I wonder&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"And there is a bear cub I call Pete," she added. "It
is because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes were shining.</p>

<p>"Because I am going to marry a man whose name
is Peter."</p>

<p>It did not seem strange to her that she should be
confessing the secret of her happiness to a man she had
never seen before.</p>

<p>There was something in his eyes which made her
want him to know, a mysterious gentleness that seemed
to plead for her confidence and her friendship. It gave
her a pleasurable thrill to tell someone that she loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Peter and was going to be his wife. And this man was
unlike any other who had ever come from the outside
world into the wilderness isolation of Five Fingers.</p>

<p>In his rags and misfortune and his whitening hair
and pale, thin face, she saw something which stirred
more than her pity. And it was more than faith.</p>

<p>Just what it was, in that moment, she did not know.
She was puzzled by the tremor which ran through his
body coincident with her mention of Peter.</p>

<p>"And this Peter&mdash;&mdash;" he began feverishly. The
words seemed to choke in his throat, and he passed a
hand over his eyes as if to wipe away a mist. Then
he said: "He is a lucky lad. Is his name Peter McRae?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How did you know?"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you love him?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "I was only thirteen then, but I loved
him the first day he came to Five Fingers and fought
Aleck Curry for me. Aleck was a bully and was
pulling my hair."</p>

<p>The mysterious stranger bent his gray head so that
she could not see his face. "That was six years ago
last May, in the afternoon. And&mdash;Peter&mdash;did he ever
tell you about&mdash;his father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that same night. It was in the edge of the
forest, and it was growing dark. He had brought a
letter from his father to Simon McQuarrie, and Simon
had told him the truth. He said his father had killed
a man&mdash;accidentally&mdash;a long time ago, but that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
police wouldn't believe it was an accident and were
after him, and would hang him if he was caught. And
ever since then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was at his side, staring at him as he slowly raised
his head, the color gone from her face and her white
throat beating with the sudden mad pounding in her
breast. "Ever since that night&mdash;that very hour&mdash;we
have prayed together for Peter's father to come back.
And you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not escape the wild questioning in her eyes
and their demand to be answered.</p>

<p>"Would you have <i>me</i> Peter's father?" he asked
uncertainly. "This way&mdash;an outlaw&mdash;ragged&mdash;dirty&mdash;a
beggar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was an almost tragic note of hopefulness in his
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried, her voice breaking in excited entreaty
from her lips. "If you are Peter's father, tell
me. We have waited. And I have told him you would
come. Oh, I have <i>promised</i> him that, and have asked
God every night to make it come true. Are you&mdash;&mdash;"
Her hands were reaching out to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Peter's father."</p>

<p>There was no flash of joy or pride in his acknowledgment
of the truth. His head sank upon his breast as
if a sudden weariness had overcome him, and a moan of
protest was in his voice. And then a thing happened
which swept the bitterness and grief from Donald McRae's
heart. He caught a glimpse of Mona's face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
gloriously flushed in this moment of her answered
prayer; and then her arms were about him, her soft
cheek against his rough stubble of beard, and for
an instant he felt the swift pressure of her lips
against his.</p>

<p>He raised his hand and touched her hair. "Child,"
he cried brokenly, "dear child&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sprang up from him, half laughing and half
sobbing, and ran out from under the mountain ash tree
and stood in the edge of the clearing. With her hands
in the form of a megaphone she called: "Peter! Peter!
<i>Oh, Peter!</i>"</p>

<p>With a protesting cry he climbed to his feet and
went to her. She saw the white, almost frightened
look in his face and eyes. "Don't do that!" he exclaimed.
"For God's sake&mdash;don't! Peter must not
know I am here."</p>

<p>In her amazement her hands fell slowly from her
face to her side. "Why?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped, listening to a voice that
came faintly from out of the forest.</p>

<p>"That is Peter," said Mona. "We are going to eat
our picnic supper here&mdash;at the pool."</p>

<p>"It is Peter&mdash;<i>coming</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He tried to breathe steadily, tried to speak calmly
as he took her hand and stroked it with nervous gentleness.
"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Mona Guyon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mona&mdash;Guyon. It is a pretty name. And you are
sweet and good and beautiful. Peter's mother was like
you. And&mdash;I am glad you love my boy." A new
strength seemed to possess him.</p>

<p>The voice came again out of the forest, a little
nearer this time, and Donald McRae held the girl's
hand closer, and a tremor went through him as he
smiled at her in the way he used to smile at his boy in
the old days of their comradeship and happiness.</p>

<p>"That is my call," he said evenly. "Peter's mother
and I used it twenty years ago, and afterward I taught
it to Peter. It carries a long distance in the woods."</p>

<p>It was not his poverty and his weakness that affected
Mona most. Something more than pity overwhelmed
her&mdash;his forced calmness, the strange light in his eyes,
the almost superhuman fight he was making to rise up
out of his rags and his misery in the most tragic
hours that could have come into his life. His words
and his appearance set her heart pounding fiercely. She
was a little frightened and wanted to put her arms
about him again and hold him until Peter came. What
did he mean?</p>

<p>"Why mustn't Peter know you are here?" she demanded.
"<i>Why?</i>"</p>

<p>He led her back in the willows. In a moment they
were hidden.</p>

<p>"Are you brave enough to hear? And do you love
Peter enough to help&mdash;me?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will help you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood so that he could look out of the willows and
across the meadow through which Peter would come.
A moment of despair and hopelessness twisted the
muscles of his face.</p>

<p>"He must not see me," he said in a voice that was
hardly more than a strained whisper. "Child, you
must understand&mdash;you most of all. Don't you know
why I ran away from Peter that day near Five Fingers,
and sent him on to Simon McQuarrie? It was
so Peter might have a chance in life that he never
could have with me, even if I escaped the law. I, too,
have prayed&mdash;every day and every night through the
years that have been more than eternities for me;
prayed that good and happiness might come to him, and
that in time even the memory of his father would wear
away. But never for an instant have I been able to
forget my boy. He has been a part of my soul and
body, walking with me, sleeping with me, sitting with
me beside my hidden camp-fires at night, until at times
the desire to see him once more was so strong in me
that it almost drove me mad. And all this time I was
hunted, running from place to place, living in swamps
and hidden depths of the forests, avoiding men and
places of habitation&mdash;but with Peter always at my side,
just as he looked that last terrible day at the edge of
Five Fingers when he pleaded with me to take him
along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His lips trembled and a shiver ran through his body.</p>

<p>"And through those years Peter <i>was</i> with you&mdash;Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and I," replied the girl. "Summer nights we used
to ask the moon where you were, and when it was cold
and stormy we&mdash;we prayed. And on Christmas&mdash;Peter
always got a present&mdash;for <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>A joyous light passed over his haggard face. "You
thought of me&mdash;on Christmas?"</p>

<p>"Yes, always. And Peter asked me to keep the
presents carefully in my cedar chest, for we knew you
would come back some day. And now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Peter's voice that came to them again, much
nearer. Donald's arms fell away from the girl, but
she raised her face quickly and kissed him. Her eyes
were filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Peter is wondering why I do not answer. Please&mdash;please&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In his indecision he bowed his face in his hands. It
was with an effort that he shook himself free of temptation.</p>

<p>"I must tell you quickly, and you must understand,"
he said desperately. "The police are close after me
again. That is why I was in the great swamp to the
north&mdash;to get away from them. If I come back into
Peter's life now it can only be for a few hours, and you
know what it will mean&mdash;a fresh tragedy for him, a new
grief, pain, disgrace, a black cloud of unhappiness over
the paradise which you have made and can make for
him. I have come back to see him, to look at him, to
carry away a new picture of him in my heart. But he
must not know. And if you love Peter&mdash;if you care a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
little for what is in the heart of his father&mdash;you will
make it possible for me to look upon my boy. I will hide
here, in the willows; and you two, there under the ash
tree&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is wrong," broke in Mona. "Oh, it is terribly
wrong!"</p>

<p>"No, it is right," he persisted. "It will make me
happy&mdash;to see him so near to me, hear his voice and
know that life and God and <i>you</i> have been good to him.
If I see Peter, child, if his hands touch me, if we are
together again&mdash;it may cost me my life. For those
things would hold me; I could not go away again after
that, and the police are near, very near, and if they
should catch me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sag that came into his shoulders gave eloquence
to the thing which he did not finish, and Mona's eyes
burned with a fire which dried up her tears. "If I
bring Peter down there, under the tree, will you promise
not to go away until I have seen you again?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise that."</p>

<p>"Even if it is tomorrow, or the next day?"</p>

<p>"I will wait."</p>

<p>It was hard for him to lie, looking into the beautiful
eyes that were fixed upon him so steadily. But he did it
splendidly; so well that Mona did not guess the falsehood
back of his last great fight.</p>

<p>She turned from him swiftly with her face toward
the meadow.</p>

<p>"I will bring Peter&mdash;down there," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>She ran to the mountain ash tree and in a few breathless
seconds rearranged the luncheon basket and tossed
half eaten bits of food into the pond. Then she hurried
across the meadow. Peter's call came to her again,
and this time she answered it. In the deep shade on
the farther side of the meadow she stopped and pressed
her hands to her face. Her cheeks were hot. She was
fighting against a sense of overwhelming guilt, for in
this hour, this very minute, she knew she was not only
betraying Peter, but committing the sacrilege of repudiating
answered prayer. And Peter must not know!</p>

<p>He could not fail to see her excitement, unless&mdash;she
laughed softly as the old, sweet thought came to her.
Peter loved her hair. He loved to see it down, as on
that first day six years ago when he came upon her
in the edge of the forest near Five Fingers. She paused
again, and her fingers worked swiftly among its lustrous
coils until they fell about her. Peter would guess
nothing now&mdash;when she came to him like this, in a way
that shut his eyes to all the rest of the world.</p>

<p>She could hear him coming through the brush. He
was running, and she guessed at the alarm which was
urging him because she had failed to answer his calls
until that last time, when she knew her voice had not
sent forth the old cry in just the way it should have
greeted Peter.</p>

<p>She stood very still, so that when Peter leaped over
a fallen tree not twenty paces away from her he did not
see her. He stopped, his head thrown back, breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
quickly, and listening; and in this moment Mona recalled
the other day of years ago when he came into
the cutting near Five Fingers and found her struggling
with Aleck Curry, the bully of the settlement.</p>

<p>He was the same Peter, only now he was a man. His
hair had not darkened and his eyes were the same
blue. He was the clean-cut, fearless, sensitive Peter
who had gone into battle for her against a boy nearly
twice his weight and years older. The years had given
a splendid change to his body. He was still slim, like
the old Peter, and there was a litheness and alertness
in him which filled her with pride. She held her breath,
watching him, and exulted when she saw the anxiety in
his face. Then he called again, and in the moment of
silence which followed she suddenly clapped her hands
and laughed.</p>

<p>Peter turned in amazement, and when he saw her
standing as she was, with her long hair streaming about
her, he drew in a deep breath, and the blood surged
into his tense face as he came to her. The happiness
which swept his anxiety away brought a responsive
glow of joy into her eyes, and as she held out her arms
to him she forgot for a moment the man hidden among
the willows near the mountain ash tree. For a little
while Peter held her so close she could feel the thumping
of his heart, and not until he had kissed her hair and
her lips did he seem to have breath to ask why she had
not answered his calls.</p>

<p>"To punish you for making me wait so long at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the pond," she said. "But"&mdash;she raised a soft tress to
his lips&mdash;"I was sorry, at the last moment, and did <i>this</i>
for you, Peter. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>She was thinking of Donald McRae again, and
slipping her hand into Peter's, she led him toward the
pond. And Peter, in the sweetness and joy of her
presence, guessed nothing because her fingers tightened
in his hand or because her breath came more quickly
than usual.</p>

<p>They drew nearer to the ash tree and the willows.
She knew that Donald McRae was now looking upon
the face of his boy; she could see the clump of twisted
bushes behind which he was hidden, and caught a movement
in their tops, as if an animal or a breath of wind
had disturbed them.</p>

<p>They were under the ash tree when she flung back
her hair, no longer making an effort to hide from Peter
the distress in her face. He was shocked, even a little
terrified at her appearance. Involuntarily her glance
went beyond him to the thicket which concealed Donald
McRae. It was only a few steps away, and she knew
Peter's father could distinctly hear what they said.
Then she looked at Peter again, and smiled gently at
his suspense as she raised one of his hands to her lips
in the soft caress that always wiped away his troubles.
And in that same moment she drew him a step nearer
to the willows.</p>

<p>"Something happened before you came," she said,
speaking so that Donald McRae would not lose a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of what she was saying. "I think I must have had a&mdash;a&mdash;dream&mdash;and
it was terrible!" She shuddered, and
listened to the breaking of a twig in the willows. "I
am foolish to let it frighten me."</p>

<p>His arms were about her, his fingers smoothing back
her shining hair as relief leaped into his face.</p>

<p>"You were asleep, <i>Ange</i>&mdash;with me bursting my
throat to make you hear from the forest?"</p>

<p>She did not answer his question. Instead, she said:
"Peter, you have not lied to me? You believe in
prayer?"</p>

<p>He bent his lips to her white forehead. "Yes, <i>Ange</i>,
and yours most of all. God has answered you, and
always will."</p>

<p>"And we have prayed a long time for your father
to come back?"</p>

<p>He nodded wonderingly. "Yes, a long time."</p>

<p>She spoke slowly then, and her words were for
Donald McRae and not for Peter.</p>

<p>"And if your father does not come, if you never see
him again, your faith in the God we have prayed to for
so long will be a little broken, will it not, Peter?"</p>

<p>She waited, holding her breath for fear even that
sound might come between Peter's answer and the
man in the bushes.</p>

<p>"He will come&mdash;some day&mdash;Mona."</p>

<p>"That was what he promised you&mdash;the day he sent
you on alone to Five Fingers, and ran away from you?
And you have always told me that next to your faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in God you believed in your father. You have never
thought that he lied to you that day in the edge of the
forest?"</p>

<p>He stared at her, speechless, and in that moment she
faced the willows with a glow of triumph in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Down in the little church at Five Fingers Father
Albanel has always taught us not to lie and to be true
to our promise," she said, speaking directly at the
willows. "Peter, if your father should break his faith,
or I should break mine, it would be terrible. And that
is what happened&mdash;in my vision&mdash;and it has frightened
me." She rested her cheek against his arm so he could
not see her face. "I was here&mdash;under the tree&mdash;when
in this vision your father came. He was ragged and
tired and sick&mdash;and so hungry he ate carrots I brought
for the beavers. He had come just to look at you,
Peter, but not to let you know. He said it would make
you unhappy; that it was best for you that he should
never come into your life again&mdash;and he made me
promise not to tell you that he was here.</p>

<p>"And I promised. I did&mdash;I promised him I would be
a traitor to you, after all the years we have waited for
him, and prayed for him, and <i>believed</i> in him."</p>

<p>Her arms crept up to his shoulders. "If I should do
a thing like that God would never forgive me, and you&mdash;if
some day you found out what I had done&mdash;would
never have faith in me again. Would you?"</p>

<p>She hid her face against his shoulder, her heart
beating wildly, her body trembling. For she had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
another movement in the willows and she was afraid
that Donald McRae was going away.</p>

<p>"It was only a dream," Peter was saying, holding his
arms closely about her. "You are not afraid of dreams,
Mona?"</p>

<p>And then from behind them came a voice.</p>

<p>"<i>God forgive me my weakness!</i>" it cried. "<i>Peter&mdash;Peter&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>Donald McRae stood out in the open at the edge
of the willow thicket. He had forgotten the rags
and mud that covered him, and was no longer a fugitive
with the lines of a hunted man in his face. The
present was for a space obliterated&mdash;the present with
its menace of the law, its exhaustion and its poverty;
and he was standing once more in the warm glow of
that day of six years ago when he had said good-by to
Peter. In those seconds, when Peter stood shocked
into deathlike stillness by the sound of the voice behind
him, Mona could see Donald McRae with his outreaching
arms; but as Peter turned slowly, facing his
father, the strain broke in a hot flood of tears that
blinded her vision.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Dad!</i>"</p>

<p>It was the strangest cry she had ever heard from
Peter's lips, and with an answer to that cry in her own
choking breast she turned away as the two men came
into each other's arms. She passed out of sight along
the edge of the pond, scarcely seeing the path ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of her, and unconsciously she kept repeating Peter's
name in a whisper, as if&mdash;even though she had prayed
so long for this hour to come&mdash;she had never quite expected
its fulfilment.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the ash tree, for a few moments Peter
was the boy again; the boy of yesterday, of
years ago, when the world had held nothing for him
but his father; and there was no change in the touch
of the hands that had always given him comfort and
courage and a love that was almost like a woman's in its
gentleness. Not until Donald McRae held his boy off,
with a hand on each shoulder, did something besides the
madness of joy at his father's homecoming begin to
thrust itself upon Peter. Then he saw the change&mdash;the
naked breast, the half-bared arms, the mud and
the rags, and the face and hair in which years had
stamped their heels unpityingly. He tried to choke
back his horror, to keep it out of his face, and to do this
he laughed&mdash;laughed through the tears and sobbing
breath&mdash;and pointed to a white birch tree in which a
blue jay was screaming.</p>

<p>"The blue jay, dad!" he cried. "Remember that day&mdash;behind
the log&mdash;with the blue jay in the tree-top,
and the sapsucker pecking at our elbows, and the violets
between my knees&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hands on his shoulders were relaxing.</p>

<p>"I've never seen a blue jay but what I've thought&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
you," said Donald McRae. "And the river&mdash;behind
us&mdash;and how we got away from the police&mdash;and the
rabbits we roasted&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" The world was
twisting and turning round again. He tried to smile,
and reached out gropingly for Peter. "The swamp was
hot, Peter. And I am tired&mdash;tired&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter's arms caught him as he swayed. His thin face
was whiter, and his eyes closed as he still tried to smile
at his boy.</p>

<p>Mona, braiding her hair as she waited beyond the
willows, heard Peter's frightened call. When she came
running to him he was kneeling beside his father, cooling
his face with water from the pond. Donald McRae
lay upon the grass. He was scarcely breathing, and
under the scrub of beard his emaciated face was like
wax. An agony of fear and grief had driven the happiness
out of Peter's face, and he tried to speak as he
looked up at Mona.</p>

<p>She saw what had happened as she knelt beside him
and took Donald McRae's head tenderly in her arms.
Excitement and his last great effort to fight down his
weakness had given a semblance of strength to this
shell of a man. But it was gone now, and the full
measure of its tragedy struck like a charge of lead to
Peter's heart.</p>

<p>Mona, feeling Peter's grief, and guessing swiftly the
thought that had made his wordless lips white and
trembling, said to comfort him: "He hasn't been this
way long, Peter. It was the swamp. He told me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
police were after him, and he hid himself there. The
heat&mdash;bad water&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She tried futilely to explain away the horror of the
thing&mdash;to make Peter believe this wreck of a man was
not the product of months and years of hardship and
suffering, but had reached his condition because of a
passing torment that had covered only a few days in
the swamp. But she knew she was failing, and she
stopped before she had finished, with her head bowed
before Peter's eyes. She heard his tense lips whisper
"the police" as if the words choked him as they came
out, and then he went down again to the edge of the
pool for water. She wet her handkerchief when he
returned and held it over Donald's eyes, and Peter unlaced
the worn-out, muddy boots&mdash;and suddenly a
sound came from him, a little cry of unutterable understanding
as his hand found in the trampled grass the
half-eaten carrot which his father had dropped.</p>

<p>She had never seen Peter's face so white, and never
before had she seen a look in his blue eyes so unlike the
Peter she had grown up with, and played with, and
loved.</p>

<p>"He is breathing easier," she said. "It was the
excitement, the shock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He nodded, and replied in a dead, even voice: "I
know what it was, <i>Ange</i>. I know." He took one of
his father's hands and held it between his own, looking
at the face in Mona's arms into which life was beginning
to return and breath to come more evenly. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
has been a long time, dad. Six years&mdash;six years like
those three days when the police were hunting us in
the forest, and you caught rabbits for me to eat. But
it is ended now."</p>

<p>Mona's heart throbbed. "We will keep him with us,
Peter&mdash;always! We will hide him&mdash;somewhere&mdash;never
let him go away again! Oh, it will be easy for
us to do that, and Father Albanel&mdash;and Simon&mdash;will
help us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A deeper breath trembled on Donald McRae's lips,
but it was not that breath, or the faint moan that came
with it, that stopped her before she had finished.
Peter was looking over her head at something beyond
her. He dropped his father's hand, and what she saw
in his face drew a gasping cry from her even before
she knew its cause. She turned and looked. And then,
in an instant, she was on her feet with Peter.</p>

<p>So quietly that no sound of footfall or breaking
twig had given warning of his approach, a man had
stolen upon them. He stood not a dozen feet away,
dressed in the field service uniform of the Provincial
Police. That was the first terrible fact which telegraphed
itself to her brain; the man was an officer,
he was after Donald McRae, and he had caught them!
But this first alarm gave place to a greater shock as
her eyes saw the face above the uniform. It was a
large, coarse face streaming with sweat; the lips were
heavy, the nose big, and the eyes were small and too
close together for one who bulked so large. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
face filled with triumph&mdash;an exultation which the man
made dramatically poignant as he stood with his heavy
hands on his hips, looking from one to the other with
a smile that was deadly in its promise twisting the
corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>He did not speak, did not even move, but waited
while his presence crushed like a weight of horror upon
the two who were staring at him. His eyes rested on
Mona, and the wicked gleam in them&mdash;the thought
which they could not hide, merciless, sure, almost
gloating&mdash;drew his name from her lips in a cry that was
filled with fear, with half disbelief, with a note that almost
called for pity.</p>

<p>"<i>Aleck&mdash;Curry!</i>"</p>

<p>The man's heavy head nodded, but he did not speak.
It was still too great a moment of triumph to be broken
by voice. He looked at Peter, and then, slowly, significantly,
at the unconscious form of Peter's father. God
could not have given him a greater hour than this! For
if it had not been for that man and for Peter, he might
have had the girl. It was Peter who had come in his
way from that first day when they had fought over
Mona in the edge of the clearing; it was Peter who had
whipped him, Peter whom he had grown to hate above
all other things on earth&mdash;and it was Peter's heart
and soul and happiness, almost his very life, that he
now held in the hollow of his hand!</p>

<p>And he would make him pay.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>it is ended now</i>," he said, repeating Peter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
words of a few moments before. "And I'm rather
glad. The swamp was hot and filled with mosquitoes."</p>

<p>Something clinked as he fumbled at his belt and the
sound sent a chill of horror through Mona. He held
out the manacle irons so that she could see them.</p>

<p>"I've got to do it," he said, a mocking apology in
his voice. "Distasteful, but necessary." He faced
Peter. "Your father knew we were close behind him,
and it won't do him any good to play dead. He's slippery,
and I'm going to put these on him. I guess&mdash;&mdash;"
He swung his heavy head toward Mona again. "I
guess Father Albanel and old Simon can't help him
very much from now on. It was nice of you to think of
it, though, Mona. You were always so tender-hearted&mdash;when
it came to Peter!"</p>

<p>He was still the old bully and his voice trembled
with the suppression of his triumph. This was his
master stroke. It was not capture of the man whom the
law would condemn to hang that thrilled him most; it
was the twisted beauty in Mona's face, the shock and
terror in her eyes, and the helplessness and despair he
saw in Peter's. He did not hurry, did not call for an
instant upon the dignity of the law, but twisted the
knife of his vengeance slowly.</p>

<p>When Mona's eyes turned from him to Peter her
heart stood still. He was gray. There was no blood in
his lips. He was looking down upon the still, upturned
face of his father, and his hands were clenched. When
he raised his head she saw that his eyes were no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Peter's eyes. He advanced slowly toward Aleck Curry,
and the manacles rattled as Aleck dropped them to his
belt and shifted a hand to his pistol holster.</p>

<p>Peter did not hear the click of steel or sense the
menace of the shifting hand. One thought pounded
maddeningly in his brain; his father had come back to
him, he was <i>home</i>, and in the first hour of his return
this beast had come into their lives again to break down
every hope and prayer they had built up during the
years. In Aleck Curry he saw not only that merciless
law which had run his father like a rat from hole to
hole, but a monster of vicious hate, a lustful, bullying
boy grown into a still more vicious giant&mdash;and Peter's
desire was to kill him.</p>

<p>Mona saw the deadly intent in his slow advance even
as Aleck Curry saw it. She saw more&mdash;the hand on
the pistol, the tightening fingers, the dangerous gleam
that flashed in Aleck's eyes&mdash;and Peter with only his
naked hands! A cry of warning came to her lips&mdash;of
a terror which robbed her of the power to move. The
cry ended in a scream, for as Peter leaped in, Aleck
raised the pistol and fired. A terrible sickness came
over her, a sickness which for an instant swept away
her strength.</p>

<p>Peter felt the hot breath of the pistol in his face
and the explosion was so near it fell like a blow against
his eardrums. It was not a shot intended only to
frighten him, for death had missed him by less than the
width of his hand. Aleck released the trigger of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
automatic and crooked his finger again, but even quicker
than that movement was Peter, who flung himself with
all his weight under his enemy's arm as the second shot
was fired. He did not strike, but with both hands
clutched Aleck's wrist, and at the same time tripped
his foe so that they went to the earth together, with
Aleck on his back.</p>

<p>In this instant there came upon Peter a crushing
realization of the almost deadly odds against him.
Into every nerve of his body flashed the truth&mdash;that he
was fighting a man who wanted to kill him, who
in reality had the right to kill him, and whom the law
would not only vindicate but would commend for killing
him. He was an outlaw, fighting against the almighty
omniscience of that law, and what the world would
regard as justice. And his survival now, like that of
his father, depended upon beating it. He must break
his enemy's wrist. Get the gun. Kill or be killed.</p>

<p>Every ounce of his strength he exerted upon the
wrist as Aleck flung his free arm in a powerful and
throttling embrace about his neck. He drew the
wrist in, twisted it, and tried with a sudden effort to
give it the final breaking snap, but it was like a piece
of steel that would not break. The thick fingers did
not loosen their hold on the pistol, and in spite of his
desperate effort Peter's staring eyes saw the black
muzzle of the weapon forcing itself a fraction of an
inch at a time toward his body.</p>

<p>Now, when it was too late, he knew that in this close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
embrace he was not a match for Aleck. His quickness
and his tirelessness counted for nothing. Aleck, slow,
heavy, with not a quarter of his endurance, but with
the brute strength of three men in his coarse body,
could crush the life out of him in close quarters. Yet
these first few thrilling instants Peter knew this
thought was not in the other's mind. All of his
enemy's great strength was being exerted in an effort
to point the pistol at his body.</p>

<p>Those two or three minutes in which he knew he
was fighting to save his life seemed like an eternity
to Peter. He saw Aleck's face, twisted in a leering
grin, its bloodshot eyes laughing at him, its thick
mouth mocking him as the powerful arm and wrist
broke down with a slow, torturing sureness all the
force he was putting against it. The gun was already
at right angles to his body, and suddenly Peter realized
why Aleck Curry had not used the choking force of
his other arm before this. He had waited for the
right moment&mdash;and that moment had come. The arm
tightened. It was like a half-ring of steel, crushing
Peter's neck and twisting his head so that his widening
eyes left the pistol and stared into the lower branches
of the ash tree.</p>

<p>In that moment he saw Mona. She was staggering
up from the edge of the pond with something in her
hands which looked like a chunk of mud. Her face
passed over him, desperately white, and then she had
fallen on her knees and he could hear the <i>beat</i>, <i>beat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
eat</i> of that something in her hands close to his ears.
A terrible cry came from Aleck Curry, and the throttling
arm about Peter's neck relaxed until he could
turn his head again, and he saw Mona pounding his
foe's pistol hand with the stone that had looked like a
chunk of mud. He saw the hand redden with blood
saw the thick fingers loosen their grip on the pistol, and
then swift as a flash Mona had snatched the big automatic
and was backing away with it in her hand.</p>

<p>With a mighty, upward heave of his body Peter
freed himself, and with that movement came a wild
cry out of him, a joyous approval of what Mona had
done. Aleck lunged after him. They came to their
feet. Peter's fist shot out to the other's jaw, and as
Aleck staggered backward, almost falling under the
force of the blow, Peter turned to take the pistol from
Mona. She was halfway to the pond, and even as he
cried out in warning and dismay the weapon left her
hand, circled through the air and disappeared with a
splash in the water. At his cry she faced him and ran
back and thrust the mud-covered rock in his hand.
Then he saw the terror in her eyes&mdash;the agony of fear
that had made her throw away the weapon that had
almost taken his life.</p>

<p>He let the rock slip from his fingers and fall to the
ground in spite of the exclamation of protest which
came from her white lips. He did not see her stoop
quickly and pick it up as he advanced to meet Aleck
Curry. His foe was hunched forward, like a gorilla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
his head lowered, his huge fists clenched, his face
distorted by the shock of Peter's blow and a rage
which gave him a terrible aspect.</p>

<p>Then he rushed in, his arms apart, his great hands
reaching for the man he hated. With the quickness
of a cat Peter met his attack, avoiding the arms and
the huge hands, leaping in, striking and darting back.
He drove blow after blow, and one of them, catching
Aleck again on the jaw, had behind it all the weight and
force of his body. But even that scarcely more than
rocked the brutish head on its thick neck. He advanced
slowly and steadily, taking the blows as he
moved like a juggernaut upon Peter, driving him an
inch at a time toward the edge of the pool.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mona ran in from behind, and with both
hands she raised her stone and beat it between Aleck's
shoulders. She raised it again, trying to strike his
neck or his head, when with a bellow Aleck flung himself
around, his great arm flying out like a beam. The
blow caught Mona with all its force and sent her in
a crumpled heap to the earth. Not a cry came from
her lips, but a yell of fury burst from Peter's. He
rushed in, and a hurricane of blows smashed into
Aleck's face, cutting his lips, blinding him and choking
the breath in his throat. But in that blindness and
pain his hand reached out and caught Peter as their
feet sank in the mud at the edge of the pond. A
cry of triumph came from his bleeding mouth. At last
his moment had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>As Peter felt himself dragged into the deadly embrace
his mind worked swiftly. His one chance now
lay in the depths of the pool, and unless he could get
his enemy there he was lost. Thrusting up his hands,
he clenched them in Aleck's hair and put all his weight
in dragging the head downward. The movement had
its effect, and a step was gained toward the edge of the
muddy shelf that terminated abruptly in eight feet of
water. Unconscious of the trap, Aleck bent himself
forward, putting all the crushing strength of
his arms in the grip about Peter's body, and as Peter
flung the weight of his head and shoulders in the same
direction their balance was upset and they plunged
into the pond.</p>

<p>As they struck the water Peter drew a great breath
into his lungs, and in the same moment his foe
relaxed his grip and began to flounder wildly in an
element in which, even in the days of their boyhood,
he had never been at home. His face rose above the
surface for an instant, and Mona saw it as she staggered
to the edge of the pond. It was then a deadly
weight attached itself to one of his kicking legs, and
not until Peter had dragged his burden to the muddy
bottom of the beaver stronghold did he release his
hold. He shot up for air, and scarcely had Aleck's
body struggled to the surface when he dived again, and
a second time bore his victim under. This time he
expelled most of the air in his lungs, and for a few
seconds hung on like an anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>A third and a fourth time, Aleck rose, fighting for
his life, but the fifth time it was Peter who buoyed
him up and brought him nearly unconscious to the
shore. He noticed the livid mark made by Aleck's
hand on Mona's forehead as she helped him drag the
heavy body out of the water. In another half-minute
he had the manacles intended for his father about
Curry's wrists, and with his belt he securely lashed his
prisoner's legs together. Then he faced Mona.</p>

<p>The same question was in their eyes. In Mona's it
was a wordless terror. Peter looked at his father.
He was stirring. A hand rose weakly from the grass.
He had seen nothing of the struggle, heard nothing,
and thought of him was first to leap into Peter's mind.</p>

<p>"He doesn't know what has happened!" he panted.
"We must get him away, Mona. If anything would
kill him now, it would be knowledge of this&mdash;that the
law has found him&mdash;and that I&mdash;in helping him&mdash;have
become an outlaw myself."</p>

<p>She came to him quickly and put her hands to his
face, just as she had done on that other day years
ago when he had fought his great battle with Aleck.
"They can't blame you alone, Peter. I helped." She
held up her lips, but instead of kissing them he pressed
his own to the reddening mark on her forehead.
"There is the little cabin," she whispered. "We can
take your father there. And&mdash;I love you, Peter!"</p>

<p>She stood back from him, her eyes shining with
sudden inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Aleck Curry had coughed the water out of his
lungs and was twisting in his bonds. His voice called
loudly as Peter bent over his father. Donald's eyes
were opening.</p>

<p>"We must hurry!" urged Mona. "We must get
away&mdash;where he is safe&mdash;where he cannot be found!"</p>

<p>Peter raised his father in his arms. The weight of
the emaciated body sent a stab of pain through him.
It was as if he had picked up the limp form of a boy.</p>

<p>Mona, close at his side, smiled into the grief-filled
eyes he turned toward her. Together they hurried
across the meadow. And then Mona ran on ahead,
following a scarcely worn path through deep timber
until in a few moments she came to another little
meadow; here, under a clump of hardwoods, was
a tiny cabin of logs&mdash;the "play-house" Peter had built
for her two winters ago as a refuge and rest place for
her when she came to visit her beaver pets. Inside a
screened porch was a couch of saplings, and on this
she had spread blankets and cushions by the time Peter
arrived.</p>

<p>Donald's eyes were wide open, and he was smiling
up wanly at Peter. "Never thought the day would
come when you'd be lugging your dad around like
this, did you, Peter?" he asked, and tried to laugh.
But the moment his head touched the soft cushions his
eyes closed again. Peter drew Mona away. "There
is a boat down on the shore of the lake," he said, his
voice steady again. "I'm going to force Aleck Curry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
into it and take him out to that little rock island two
miles from the mainland. No one ever goes near it,
and we can keep him there a prisoner until dad gets
well, and then&mdash;&mdash;" An angry yell came from the
beaver pond. "Aleck is getting nervous," he finished.
"You stay with dad, Mona. Tell him I've gone to
Five Fingers for things he needs. I'll come back that
way, and will get here before dark. Good-by, <i>Ange</i>!"</p>

<p>He kissed her. For a moment Mona clung to his
hand.</p>

<p>"When you are down by the big stub&mdash;and if
everything is all right&mdash;send me back the call," she
entreated.</p>

<p>She watched him until he disappeared. Then she
sat down close beside Donald McRae and held one of
his limp hands. After what seemed to be a long time
there came back to her clearly Peter's signal-cry, telling
her that all was well, and that he was on his way
to the prison island with Aleck Curry.</p>

<p>Over the forest fell a deep and quieting silence.
Never had it seemed so intense to Mona, as she sat
with Donald McRae's hand held closely in her own.
The man's fingers were intertwined with hers as if he
was afraid she would leave him; and his breath, coming
more evenly and yet as faintly as the breath of a
child, told her that complete exhaustion had at last
overcome him with a sleep that was almost like death.</p>

<p>Twilight dusk began to fill the aisles of the woods,
and with this dusk the last red glow died out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
west, and with it came the hour Mona loved more than
all others&mdash;when darkness began to close in a velvety
mantle over the world. The stillness, the soft whisperings
of the forest and the peace that always came
with night gave her courage and strengthened her
faith. And at last, from beyond the beaver pond,
she heard again Peter's cry. He was returning.</p>

<p>And as if he, too, had heard that cry, Donald
McRae stirred softly and whispered Peter's name.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Quietly</span> Mona went out to meet Peter.
"He is sleeping," she said, as Peter's arm closed
about her in the thickening darkness. "If he can only
pass the night that way he will be strong and well
again in the morning." Yet her voice trembled as
she tried to bring him comfort. "Aleck is safe?"
she whispered. "He is on the island?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is safe for tonight&mdash;and maybe for a
number of days. After that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, not knowing how to finish, and Mona's
soft hand caressed his cheek. "We will tell Simon,
and Uncle Pierre, and Father Albanel," she suggested.
"Surely they will know how to help us!"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about that," he said slowly, with
his lips against her hair. "You must promise me not
to tell them, Mona. I think it is necessary. At least
they must not know until tomorrow or the next day.
Will you remember that?"</p>

<p>"You are sure it is best?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"Then I will remember."</p>

<p>They drew near to the door of the cabin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
listened. Faintly they could hear Donald McRae's
breath as he slept.</p>

<p>"I must take you home," he whispered.</p>

<p>They hurried through the gloom, hand in hand. In
half an hour they had reached the cliff trail that led to
Five Fingers, and here Mona insisted that Peter turn
back, while she went on alone. She was glad Pierre
and Josette were at Joe's house when she came to the
settlement. She called good night to them through
the open door, and went to her room, with the excuse
that she was tired.</p>

<p>She sat down at her window, and watched the moon
come up. Later she heard Pierre and Josette when
they returned. And after that, one after another, the
lights went out in Five Fingers until the cabins lay
like great shadows in the slumbering stillness. In
this stillness she heard the clock in her bedroom tick
off every second of the hours.</p>

<p>Until now she had never believed that answered
prayer could bring with it a grimness and torture of
tragedy like that which had descended upon her life
and Peter's. Passionately she sobbed out her hatred
for Aleck Curry, the monster who at last had descended
upon them with his vengeance.</p>

<p>As the hours dragged on she found herself fighting
more and more desperately against the desire to steal
quietly from her room, tiptoe down the stairs and go
to Simon McQuarrie's cabin that she might confide in
him all that had happened that afternoon. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Peter's warning to keep their secret locked tightly in
her own breast held her back. Yet in Simon rested
her last hope, for from the first day Peter had come
into the old Scotchman's life he had found home&mdash;and
a protection and love which in Mona's thoughts made
him almost of Simon's flesh and blood. The impulse
to go to him&mdash;to be false to Peter for the first time
in her life&mdash;was a torment in her brain, and where one
little voice had urged her at first, a hundred added to
their insistence now. Slowly the revolt became a conviction
that it was right and reasonable she should go
to Simon, in spite of her promise to Peter.</p>

<p>Quietly she opened the door to her room and went
down the stairs, making no sound to disturb Pierre
and Josette Gourdon. A slim, pale figure, she crossed
the clearing and paused in the shadow of the cabin
where the Scotchman lived. Instinctively she looked
up at Peter's window even though she knew he was in
the forest with his father. Then she knocked on the
door. Her heart throbbed as she listened for a
response inside. It seemed to beat loudly, as if crying
out against her faithlessness in breaking a promise to
Peter. She knocked again, and in a moment she
could hear McQuarrie moving. She counted his slow
footsteps as they came across the floor. Then the
door opened, and his tall, gaunt figure stood above
her, swathed in a nightgown that fell to the toes of his
feet. At any other time Mona would have laughed at
the grotesqueness of his appearance as he stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
down into her white face, with a nightcap on the back
of his head.</p>

<p>He reached out a hand. "<i>Ange!</i>" he gasped.
"<i>You!</i> What is the matter?"</p>

<p>She slipped past him and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Please light a lamp," she said. "Please&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Simon struck a match. The flare of it illumined
his face, tense and set in its amazement. When the
lamp was lighted he took down a coat from a peg in
the wall and put it on. Then he turned to Mona
again. She stood before him with her hands clasped
at her breast, and in her dark eyes was a look that
alarmed him. And he could see in her bare throat
the little heart-beating throb that always came when
she was stirred by deep emotion.</p>

<p>With a desperate little cry she caught his hand.
"Something terrible has happened," she whispered.
"Something&mdash;you should know. But I promised
Peter. I promised him I would tell no one&mdash;not even
you. But I've got to turn that promise into a lie. If I
don't&mdash;&mdash;" The words broke on her lips. And then:
"Peter's father has come back. He is with Peter now
in the cabin near the beaver pond!"</p>

<p>Simon McQuarrie stood back from her, his hands
dropping slowly and limply to his sides. Then he
raised one of them as if to brush a shadow from his
forehead, and his nightcap fell to the floor. "Donald
McRae&mdash;has come back!" he repeated, and the deep
lines in his face softened as Mona looked at him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
joy trembled in his voice when he spoke. "Thank
God, <i>Ange</i>! Why do you think it is so terrible? We
have waited and hoped for a long time&mdash;&mdash;" He
stopped. What he saw in her face and eyes swept a
sudden change into his own, and he caught her arm as
the gladness died on his lips. "Has anything happened?"
he demanded. "Has anything happened&mdash;to
Peter&mdash;or to Donald McRae?"</p>

<p>She began telling him in a low voice, while Simon
stared at her with his big hands reaching out as if to
grip at something in the space between them.</p>

<p>"I was at the beaver pond when Peter's father staggered
out of the willows and almost fell at my feet. I
didn't know who the man was, but he was sick and
tired and starving&mdash;so hungry he ate carrots I had
meant for the beavers. I gave him our lunch, and
while he was eating I learned he was Peter's father.
It made me happy. Peter was coming to join me, and
I told Donald McRae. He begged me not to let Peter
know he was there. He wanted to hide in the bushes,
and look at him without being seen, and then go away
again. He said that was why he had come back&mdash;just
to get a look at his boy. He told me the police were
after him again, that they were driving him like a rat
from hole to hole, and that his presence could only
bring unhappiness and tragedy to Peter. So he hid
in the willows, and Peter came."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"In the end Peter's father staggered out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
bushes, and I left them together. Peter called me a
little later and I ran back. Donald McRae was on the
ground and at first I thought he was dead. Not until
then did I realize how terribly sick and weak he was.
We were on our knees beside him when he looked up,
and there&mdash;there&mdash;grinning down at us&mdash;was the man
Peter's father had been running away from. Oh, he
was terrible&mdash;big and sweaty and leering down at us,
almost laughing in his triumph, and&mdash;Simon&mdash;Simon&mdash;it
was <i>Aleck Curry</i>!"</p>

<p>Her despair broke in a sobbing cry, and now the
bones of Simon's great hands made a snapping sound
as he clenched them, and his thin, hard face was
gray in the glow of the lamp. "What happened then,
Mona?"</p>

<p>"When Aleck went to put the manacles on Peter's
father there was a fight&mdash;a terrible fight&mdash;and Aleck
tried to kill Peter with a gun. He shot twice. I
helped with a stone, and at last Peter got him into the
pond, and almost drowned him. His father was still
unconscious when we carried him to the cabin. Then
Peter took Aleck down to his boat and to the little
rock island two miles out from the shore. He is there
now&mdash;a prisoner. And&mdash;what will happen to Peter?
What can the law do to him?"</p>

<p>Simon paced slowly back and forth across the floor.
His face was a mask of iron. His long nightgown
flapped about his feet, and again his big, hard hands
hung limp and straight at his sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"If Aleck escapes from the island and arrests Peter,
or reports the affair to headquarters, it means the
penitentiary," he said as if speaking to himself rather
than to Mona. "And that is what will happen&mdash;if
Curry has his way. He hates Peter. He would like to
see Donald McRae hung, and Peter in prison, and
<i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;" A tigerish gleam was in his eyes as he
faced her. "Why didn't Peter kill him when he had
the chance?" he cried, as for a single moment his self-control
broke its leash. "As a boy he was a brute and
a bully, and as a man his soul is that of a monster&mdash;even
though now he is a part of the law. He wanted
you&mdash;always. I know it and could see it even when
you were children. And for what he wants he would
wreck the world. Why didn't Peter kill him?
Why&mdash;with these two hands&mdash;&mdash;" He reached out
his long arms and his fingers closed like talons of
steel. Then he checked his passion. His arms dropped
again. "But it is best he didn't," he finished. "It is
best&mdash;even though a snake has a better right to live
than Aleck Curry!"</p>

<p>He continued his pacing across the floor, and with
each step his stern face grew harder until at last it
seemed to have no emotion at all&mdash;the hard, set, fighting
face which Simon McQuarrie always turned upon
his enemies. For a few moments he seemed to forget
Mona. Then he asked: "What is Peter going to do?
What does he <i>plan</i> to do?"</p>

<p>The question was so sharp it sent a little shiver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
through her, and Simon's eyes were looking at her
with the steely coldness of ice.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Peter doesn't know&mdash;except that
he means to keep Aleck Curry on the island until his
father is well and can get safely away."</p>

<p>Simon grunted. "You mean the rock with nothing
on it&mdash;two miles straight out from the beaver pond?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The fingers of Simon's hands were twisting again.</p>

<p>"Constable Carter dropped in on us late this afternoon,"
he said shortly. "He told Pierre and Dominique
he was on his way into the Georgian Bay country
and would rest here for a few days. He lied.
He's working with Aleck Curry, and if Aleck doesn't
show up soon&mdash;if he starts smoke signals going out
on the island, and Carter sees them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aleck hasn't any matches," Mona interrupted him
quickly. "Peter took them away from him."</p>

<p>Simon's face was lightened for an instant by a flash
of exultation. "Peter is improving," he conceded.
"If he had only used as good judgment at the beaver
pond, when he could have rid us of this snake
forever&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mona's cry of horror stopped him. In a moment
he was at her side, and his long arms were about her
tenderly. "I didn't mean that, Ange!" he cried, trying
to laugh as he saw the agony of fear in her eyes. "It's
a bad situation, so bad that I don't see a way out for
Peter just now&mdash;but we won't kill Aleck, and we'll get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Peter out of it somehow. He was right in making
you promise not to tell anyone, and I'll keep it all to
myself&mdash;even from Peter and my old friend Donald
McRae&mdash;until Carter leaves the settlement. I'll manage
to get him away in a day or two. And meanwhile
you and Peter must keep Curry on the island, and
watch every step you take so that Carter won't get
suspicious. And above everything else&mdash;<i>most
important of all</i>&mdash;don't tell Peter you have confided
in me. Let me know everything that happens, but
don't tell Peter that I know. Do you understand,
Mona?"</p>

<p>She felt the suppression of something in his voice
that was unlike Simon McQuarrie, something that
thrilled and frightened her, yet she nodded her head
and said: "Yes, I understand. I won't let Peter
know. And I'll tell you&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>His arms drew her a little closer, and in him above
all other men she had faith in that moment. She did
not see his face above her, a face which for a single
instant darkened with a look so pitiless and menacing
that even Simon sensed the danger of its betrayal, and
held her for a moment longer. Then with the gentleness
which love for Mona and Peter had bred into his
stern nature, he led her to the door.</p>

<p>"You must go home now, and to bed," he said. "It
is your fight as well as Peter's, and you mustn't let
anyone see that you are worried tomorrow&mdash;especially
Carter." He opened the door. "Good night, <i>Ange</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good night!" she whispered as she slipped out.</p>

<p>He closed the door and listened for a moment to her
retreating footsteps. When he faced the lamp and
looked up at Peter's room, a new and strange light
was in his eyes, and he spoke softly, as if to the spirit
of someone who was waiting and listening up there.</p>

<p>"It's my turn now, and I'll care for Peter," he said.
"A long time ago Donald McRae killed the man who
insulted his mother, and it is no more than right and
just that Simon McQuarrie should kill the man who
would destroy her boy."</p>

<p>Then, slowly, he began to dress.</p>

<p>For a little while Mona hesitated in the shadow of
the tall spruce tree that grew not far from Simon's
door. She could hear her heart beating as she looked
back at the light in the cabin. She was glad it was
over, glad she had told Simon the truth, even as she
thought of her promise to Peter.</p>

<p>Yet one thing she had kept to herself, and for a
moment she felt the urge to go back and confide in the
iron-willed Scotchman her own personal fear of Aleck
Curry. Never until this night had she been afraid of
him. She had defied and hated him as a young girl,
and as she grew older had loathed and repulsed him
for the persistence of his passion. To fear him had
never entered her head, even in the days when once
or twice she had used her hands in defending herself
against, his unwelcome attentions.</p>

<p>But now she knew that Aleck's hour had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Even though he was temporarily a prisoner on the
island, he held her happiness and Peter's fate in the
hollow of his hand. That fact, its significance, its
terrible import for her, she had seen in Aleck's exultant
face and eyes at the pool. In that hour his joy and
triumph was not that he had run down Peter's father,
but that <i>she</i> at last had come within the reach of his
desires. And the fight had added to his mastery, for
it had outlawed Peter and had given to the man she
hated the final power to wreck her world. And she,
of all that world, was the only one who knew what
Aleck's price for the freedom of those she loved
would be.</p>

<p>The thought was a monstrous thing in her brain.
She had fought it, had beaten it back with the strength
of her will, and she struggled with it again as she
turned away from the light in Simon's window. Her
hands clenched and a bit of savagery leaped through
her blood as she went again through the moonlight.
She had seen the deadly fire in the Scotchman's eyes,
and that fire was now in her own. Over and over she
told herself that she was still unafraid of Aleck Curry.
Her lips whispered the words. But in her heart, fixed
and implacable, remained the fear.</p>

<p>She had almost reached the shadow of Pierre
Gourdon's cabin when a figure stepped out to meet
her. It was Peter. His startled face questioned her
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I thought you were asleep," he said in a low voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
"And so&mdash;I was passing under your window. I
wanted to be near you for a few moments."</p>

<p>He put his arms about her and looked anxiously
into her face, and then he laid his lips against her soft
hair.</p>

<p>"It was impossible." She shivered against him. "I
undressed, as you told me to do, and I went to bed.
But I had to get up. I kept thinking, thinking&mdash;until
I felt like screaming, or jumping out of my window
and running to you."</p>

<p>"You are a little frightened, <i>Ange</i>&mdash;after what happened
at the pool. But it will all come out right.
Aleck is safe. He can't harm us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up quickly, and saw in his eyes the same
look that had been in Simon's. Her arms tightened
about him.</p>

<p>"Peter, you don't need to hide anything from me,"
she protested. "We're both thinking the same thing&mdash;afraid
of the same thing. It's Aleck Curry&mdash;and
what he will do when he gets off the island. We can
keep him there until your father is well, and safe.
But after that&mdash;what will happen to you?"</p>

<p>Peter tried to laugh. "They can't do anything
worse than send me to prison, and if they do that&mdash;would
you mind waiting for me, <i>Ange</i>?"</p>

<p>She knew the effort he was making to speak lightly,
almost playfully, and her heart throbbed with the
eager quickness of her answer. "I would wait for
you all my life, Peter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>With a sudden movement he drew her into the
shadow of the cabin. His eyes were searching the
farther edge of the clearing.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said.</p>

<p>Her eyes pierced the moon glow. And then, dimly,
she saw a moving shadow. It came nearer, and
turned toward Simon's cabin. Instinctively she
guessed who it was, but waited for Peter to speak.</p>

<p>"I found him nosing around when I returned to the
settlement," he said. "A little while ago he was here,
looking up at your window; then he went to Simon's,
and afterward sneaked off into the edge of the forest.
I don't know who he is, but I was within ten feet of
him and he wears a uniform like Aleck's. He is
watching for dad. He is also suspicious and is wondering
why Aleck doesn't show up."</p>

<p>"His name is Carter," said Mona. "He came to
Five Fingers this afternoon."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time they stood in the shadow of the
cabin, and the sleepy stillness of the night with
its soft chirping of crickets and gentle murmuring of
the lake surf brought a soothing peace to Mona.
With Peter's arms about her she was no longer afraid.
He told her what had happened since she left his
father. Twice Donald McRae had awakened from
his sleep of exhaustion and had asked for her. A
thrill of pleasure was in Peter's voice as he told her
this; it made him happy to know that his father loved
her, and that he even whispered her name in his
feverish slumber. Some day the whole of their prayer
would be answered; things would turn out right; and
they would all be happy.</p>

<p>Not until he had gone, and she was alone in her
room, did Mona note how swiftly the time had passed.
The hour hand of the little clock was at three. She
did not undress, but sat down at her window, with
her face turned toward the coming of the dawn. And
now that Peter's love and the unbreakable strength of
his optimism were no longer at her side, her thoughts
began pressing upon her again, dispelling the comfort
he had given her and weakening once more her faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and hope in what the day would bring. She was glad
she confided in Simon, for he was the rock to which
she clung in these hours of her own helplessness. And
yet&mdash;what could Simon do? Wherein was he less
helpless than herself&mdash;or Peter? She shivered as she
recalled the grim and terrible look that had last rested
in his face. And that same look had been in Peter's&mdash;a
flash which he had tried to hide from her! Her
heart jumped and for an instant her fingers clutched
at the sill of her window. Would one of them&mdash;Simon
or Peter&mdash;<i>kill Aleck Curry</i>?</p>

<p>It seemed to her that a terrible truth rushed upon
her all at once and caught like a living thing at her
throat until it was difficult for her to breathe. There
was no hope for Peter as long as Aleck lived! The
words almost came from her lips. Unless Peter ran
away, wandering and hiding like his father, no power
could keep him from going to prison. But if Aleck
should never leave the little island&mdash;if he died there&mdash;and
no one knew of the fight at the pool&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She bowed her face in her arms. It would be so
easy of accomplishment&mdash;so terribly and frighteningly
easy! Peter might do it! And Simon&mdash;the
look in his face&mdash;his eyes&mdash;what he said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, no," she whispered to herself. "Anything&mdash;anything
but that!"</p>

<p>She raised her head to meet the first rose-flush of
the dawn. But this morning there was no responsive
thrill in Mona's breast. A question was repeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
itself in her brain. Would she be able to go through
the day without giving herself away? Could she meet
Pierre and Josette Gourdon, and Marie Antoinette,
and Father Albanel, and Adette and Jame Clamart&mdash;and
not let them see her torture? Would it show in
her face when she met Carter, of the Provincial
Police?</p>

<p>Until the first white spirals of smoke began rising
from the cabin chimneys she sat at her window. Then
she rose, and her beautiful face was almost stern in its
resolution. She let the sunlight stream into her room,
and in its radiance she unbraided her hair and brushed
it until it lay about her in the rippling glory that
made Peter the happiest and proudest of all men. She
dressed it carefully, and tried to sing as she made
herself ready to help Josette with the breakfast&mdash;for
she always sang in this first hour of the day. But the
notes seemed to stifle her this morning.</p>

<p>It was then, looking out from her window, that she
saw a grayish haze rising between her and the face of
the sun, and the smell of it came to her faintly. It
was smoke.</p>

<p>When she went below it was Pierre she met first.
He kissed her. But anxiety was in his face.</p>

<p>"It is happening again this year," he said. "The
forests to the north and west are afire. It will not
come near Five Fingers, but it makes my heart ache
to know that a world is being turned dead and black
because of someone's carelessness!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was the fire which gave Mona an excuse for
what was lacking in her eyes when she went to help
Josette with the breakfast. And it was this same fire,
with its thickening gloom of smoke, which helped her
through the day. For to Mona a living tree had life
and soul, and to see trees destroyed in countless thousands
was a tragedy in her life only a little less terrible
than the plague of smallpox which had once cast its
shadow upon Five Fingers.</p>

<p>She went to Simon's cabin as soon after breakfast
as she could make an excuse, and there she met Carter.
Her first glimpse of him filled her with uneasiness and
dislike. He was a hawk-nosed, shifty-eyed man in
whom nature seemed to have sacrificed every softening
quality to an uncompromising sense of duty, and his
eyes rested upon her face so intently as Simon introduced
them that she felt her heart tremble. But if he
knew of her previous visit to Simon's cabin, or of her
meeting with Peter, he gave no evidence of it, and
after a casual remark or two about the fire he left her
alone with the Scotchman.</p>

<p>A worried look was in McQuarrie's eyes.</p>

<p>"I've found out more about Carter," he said. "He
is the best man in this division and is never sent out
on minor affairs. Leaving us so quickly right now
shows how clever he is. He doesn't want to create
suspicion. He dropped in to ask me the best trail
northwest, and says he is going to leave in half an
hour to make a report on the fire. That's another lie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
In the woods he is like a cat, and he won't go half a
mile from the settlement. He is wondering where
Peter is, and if he once gets on his trail&mdash;&mdash;" Suddenly
he drew his hands together, and a grim smile
gathered about his mouth. "If Carter goes to that
fire, I'm going with him!" he exclaimed. "Five Fingers
is interested, and he cannot very well turn me
down."</p>

<p>In a few words Mona told of Peter's visit; and
then, standing so near that he could not avoid the
directness of her eyes, she gave low voice to her suspicion
that either he or Peter was planning to kill
Aleck Curry.</p>

<p>The effect of her words on Simon startled her. He
stood dumb, staring at her. Then one of his bony
hands reached out and rested on her shoulder. Its
fingers hurt her. "Don't even whisper that anywhere&mdash;but
here," he said. "You understand? <i>Don't!</i>
Peter won't kill him. And I'm not worrying about
Aleck Curry now. It's Carter."</p>

<p>He left her without another word, and went out to
overtake Carter. There was something so grim and
foreboding in his movement that it chilled her, and as
she dropped a few steps behind him she noticed his
boots. At midnight she had seen them in his cabin,
clean and freshly oiled. Now they were frosted with
half-dried mud to their tops. His sourness, the harshness
of his fingers on her shoulder, his silence now
and the aggressive hunch of his shoulders, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
with the mud on his boots, tightened her breath. Had
Simon already accomplished the thing she feared? Was
that why he was so anxious to follow Carter, go with
him&mdash;get him away from Five Fingers? She ran up to
him, meaning to demand the truth.</p>

<p>He anticipated her intention and spoke almost
roughly. "Don't ask questions, Mona. Carter has
stopped, and is looking. Go home&mdash;and stay in if you
can't keep control of yourself."</p>

<p>The rest of the morning Mona waited anxiously for
Peter. At noon, when they were at dinner, Pierre
Gourdon talked of little but the fire. It had surely
crossed the line of rail thirty miles north, he said, and
was traveling steadily eastward. If the wind should
quicken and swing into the south there would be
danger to the forests about Five Fingers. But the
settlement itself was safe, protected as it was by fire-lines
and cultivated fields on three sides, and Lake
Superior on the other.</p>

<p>He wondered where Simon McQuarrie was, and
asked Mona if she had seen Peter. He surmised they
had gone back to the crests of the high ridges to make
a closer observation of the fire. He had already sent
out Jame Clamart and Poleon Dufresne to guard the
northern ridges, and if the fire threatened to break
coastward, all the men in Five Fingers would go out
to fight it. He had made preparations. But he didn't
like the way Peter and Simon were missing, without
leaving any word behind them. Carter was gone, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Afternoon saw smoke settling like a thin fog about
the clearing. The sun was entirely hidden. Animals
and fowls came up to the buildings, and men and
women gave up their work to discuss with one another
the possibilities of the next few hours. A dozen times
Mona repressed the desire to steal away and go to the
little cabin where Donald McRae was hidden. She
knew Peter was there, and now that the smoke was
thickening she believed he would soon leave for the
settlement.</p>

<p>She noticed how hot and sultry it had grown in the
last hour. Scarcely a breath of air was stirring, and
in the middle of the afternoon Adette Clamart insisted
that she go with her for a swim down in the inlet.
While they were in the water Peter came up from the
lake in a boat. His sail was down and he was rowing.
Adette Clamart covered her pretty eyes with her two
hands while he bent over to kiss Mona, and in that
moment he whispered, "I want to see you in the
cabin." He was acting strangely, Mona thought.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she joined him in the cabin.</p>

<p>"Dad is better," Peter said. "But tonight I'm
going to get him away&mdash;somewhere. I'm afraid of
the fire. With a bad wind it would be on us in an hour
or two. Right now I want to take some supplies over
to Aleck Curry. Then I'll come back and see you before
I return to dad. There's a little breeze on the lake,
and I can make the island in an hour. Have you seen
Carter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"This morning. He hasn't been here since then."</p>

<p>"And Simon?"</p>

<p>"He is gone, too."</p>

<p>She got a bundle she had prepared and said good-by
to Peter but not until he had promised to return
directly from the island by way of the inlet. She
watched him until he disappeared in the gray haze
that hung over the water, and then looked at the clock
to mark the time he would be returning. Scarcely had
she done this when a figure stalked past one of the
windows. Instantly she recognized it as Simon
McQuarrie. He went straight to his cabin, entered it
and closed the door. <i>And Carter was not with him!</i></p>

<p>Her heart throbbed as she went outside, determined
to follow him. But something held her back. Then
she forced herself to follow her first impulse, and a
moment later was knocking at Simon's door. There
was no answer. She persisted, knocking loudly and
calling his name, and still there was no response.
Then she tried the door and found it locked. Where
there had been fear in her breast there was now conviction.
The tiger in the old Scotchman had been at
work, and in his own way&mdash;<i>and the only way</i>&mdash;he had
solved the great problem of her life and Peter's, and
had made the world free again for his old friend
Donald McRae. He had rid the island of Aleck
Curry, and had done away with Carter. And now he
wanted to be alone&mdash;alone in his cabin!</p>

<p>Not for a moment did she question the reasonableness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of her conviction. It seized upon her like a
many-tentacled thing, choking back her doubt and
overwhelming her with its certainty. It made her
steal pantingly to the edge of the forest, and then to
the beginning of the long finger of spruce and cedar
that reached away out to the entrance of Middle
Finger Inlet. Half an hour later she was on the sand
and gravel beach under the big cliff, waiting for
Peter's return. And now she noticed a change in the
wind. Loose tresses of her hair blew seaward. That
meant the fire would come over the ridges!</p>

<p>In another quarter of an hour she could scarcely
see the farther side of Middle Finger Inlet. A black
pall of smoke was creeping closer in the north and
west. Then, very faintly, she saw something creeping
up like a ghost out of the smoke gloom of the
sea. She knew it was Peter. He was coming with
nerve-racking slowness, it seemed to her. Yet she
did not want to cry out to him until he was nearer.
He was using his oars, and at times there was a half-minute
interval between his strokes. Why was he so
slow? Was it because of what he had found on the
island? Surely Simon would have left no telltale
signs. So far as Peter was concerned Aleck Curry
could only be <i>missing</i>&mdash;nothing more!</p>

<p>A shudder ran through her. Then she cried Peter's
name. Her voice carried strangely clear. There was
silence in the boat. The oars were resting without a
sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peter," she cried again. "Peter! I am here&mdash;on
the point!"</p>

<p>He must have heard her, and it was unusual that
he did not answer. But the oars rattled again, and she
could see the shape of the boat turning slowly, and
then growing larger as it came toward her. It was
odd, too, that Peter did not come directly to the point,
but grounded his boat among the big rocks fifty yards
below her&mdash;a place where he knew it was difficult for
her to go. So she stood on the white sand, waiting
for him. She could hear his boots on the rocks; then
she saw him approaching through a dusk of early
twilight thickened by the smoke of the fire.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Peter," she called softly.</p>

<p>It did not seem like Peter, for the figure was
grotesquely large, and slower of movement. She held
out her arms, and her eyes were glowing. It was the
smoke and the dusk that made Peter look like that!
And then her heart stopped beating. The figure was
within ten feet of her. It was not Peter. <i>It was
Aleck Curry!</i></p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> that moment Mona felt for the first time in her life
the giving way of living tissue under the sudden
overwhelming stress of complete shock. Strength
left her body, her arms dropped limply, and she felt
herself swaying, as if about to fall. Had there been
anything near her she would have caught at it. She
did not know that to Aleck Curry she was betraying
no physical sign of her weakness&mdash;that she was standing
like a lifeless creature carved out of rock, except
that her wide eyes were blazing and her lips parted.
What seemed an age to her covered but a few seconds.
Then her mind leaped back, fierce in its command of
her. She was wrong! Simon had not been to the
island! He had not harmed Aleck Curry&mdash;and Aleck
had returned in Peter's boat. <i>What had happened to
Peter?</i></p>

<p>She did not ask the question. It blazed out of her
eyes as Aleck advanced until he was almost within
arm's reach of her. He had on only shirt and
trousers, and he was barefooted. She could see his
naked throat. And surprise, joy, the knowledge of
his mastery lay in his heavy face. It was transformed.
He smiled at her, and his great arms reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
out as if he were Peter and she would come into them.</p>

<p>"I made a bargain with Peter," he said, "and he
changed places with me. I made him see how much
it meant for him, and for his father, and for you. I'd
let his father go and forget everything&mdash;for something
I want. So he changed places with me, and I've
come to see you. Lucky you're here. Lucky you
called."</p>

<p>It was a clumsy lie, and stumbled on his lips. The
menace of him filled her with horror. But she did not
let him see it&mdash;now. He came a step nearer, and she
backed away from him. Suddenly her mind whipped
inspirational words from her lips. She looked up
swiftly to the top of the cliff. "I don't want Carter to
see you here," she cried quickly. "He walked down
the point with me, and I think he's up there."</p>

<p>The significance of her words was not lost upon
Aleck. He moved nearer to the cliff, so that one
above could not see them. She followed him, fighting
back her fear.</p>

<p>"Why don't you want Carter to see us?" he asked
in a throaty whisper.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;if he saw us&mdash;everything would be lost.
You would not dare help me then. And you will,
Aleck&mdash;you will help me, won't you?" He was
stunned by the change in her. She had laid a hand
on his arm. Her eyes were shining at him. "But you
must tell me the truth. There isn't any need to lie.
What did you do to Peter&mdash;when he came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
island?" Her fingers pressed his flesh. There was
almost a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"The smoke was thick," said Aleck. "I heard him
coming and hid in the water. Then I stunned him
with a club. He ain't bad&mdash;not badly hurt&mdash;but he's
safe enough on the island!"</p>

<p>Mona crushed back the little cry of relief that
wanted to come to her lips. Her eyes glowed at
Aleck, and suddenly one of his big hands closed about
the one she had laid on his arm. She could feel his
breath as he bent over her. "I told you my time would
come," he cried in a husky, exultant voice. "<i>My day!</i>
And it's here. I got 'em both&mdash;safe&mdash;one to hang,
the other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Sh-h-h!</i>"</p>

<p>She placed a finger to her lips. It was an excuse
to draw away from him, get her hand free&mdash;and not
let him hear the terrified beating of her heart. She
looked up again at the cliff.</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything?"</p>

<p>"No. And if anyone hears <i>us</i> it's going to be your
fault and not mine!"</p>

<p>It was impossible to escape the look in his face and
eyes. It was not necessary for him to use words.
But Mona did not flinch from her peril. It was not
only her danger, but Peter's, and Donald McRae's,
and Simon's if he had harmed Carter. It had suddenly
and unexpectedly become her fight&mdash;all hers,
and she knew that Aleck Curry thought she was yielding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and that the brute in him was held in leash only
by this belief that was beginning to possess him. If
he guessed the truth, guessed that she was fighting to
trick him, nothing would save her, not even her assertion
that Carter was on the cliff above them. So she
smiled again at Aleck, and laughed very softly, with
a nervous twisting of her hands. Her eyes had never
looked at him as they were looking at him now. They
were like glowing stars, velvety-soft&mdash;hiding hate and
desperation behind them. She had never looked half
so beautiful, or so unresisting, to Aleck Curry.</p>

<p>Her fingers pressed his arm again.</p>

<p>"I must get Carter away," she whispered. "I've
got to do it, Aleck! He mustn't know. I'll hurry.
And then I'll come back. I promise!"</p>

<p>Horror seized her as she felt him drawing her
toward him. But still she did not resist. With a low
cry his great arms were about her. She felt herself
almost broken against him, and then she was helpless,
her head bent back, and his thick lips killing her with
kisses. Again her strength left her, and she lay limp
in his arms, smothered in his passion. Those moments
of helpless and agonized passiveness saved her. To
Aleck it was surrender. His arms loosened and
allowed her to breathe. Weakly she pressed against
him, and he allowed her partly to free herself. But
she could still feel his hot breath like a poisonous fume
in her face. He bent forward and kissed her again&mdash;on
the mouth. It almost choked her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must&mdash;must get Carter away!" she gasped.
"Then I'll come back. If you won't let me do that, I'll&mdash;I'll
scream&mdash;and Carter will hear us. But if you'll
let me get him away, so he'll never know&mdash;never be
able to tell Peter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was unnecessary for her to finish. Aleck's face was
transformed by an iniquitous joy. He looked close
into her face, and she looked back at him, unafraid.</p>

<p>"I'll let you go&mdash;and get Carter away," he said.
"If you don't come back soon, I'll go to Five Fingers&mdash;and
you know what that means for Peter and his
father."</p>

<p>"I'll come," she lied.</p>

<p>She climbed up the narrow footpath to the top of
the cliff, and getting her breath there, she called
Carter's name&mdash;loudly enough for Aleck to hear.</p>

<p>Then she began to run. She was still weak, and it
seemed to her that the poison of Aleck Curry's
embraces and kisses followed her. She began to sob
under her breath. There was no turning of the ways
for her now. She must tell someone the truth&mdash;anyone&mdash;the
first man she met. But Simon first of all.
On the little island Peter might be dying. Maybe
Aleck had killed him, for it was in his power to do so
and still be within the law. She began to moan his
name. Then she came to the crest of a high knoll
which was bare of trees, and what she saw ahead of
her stopped her, gulping for breath and almost falling
in her exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>A wind was in her face. And northward there was
no longer a black pall of smoke but a world afire.
The glow of the conflagration reached from the earth
to the sky. It swept in a great arc, and red seas of
flame were leaping from peak to peak of the farther
ridges. Pierre Gourdon's fear had become a reality.
The fire was racing with the speed of the wind itself
upon Five Fingers!</p>

<p>She ran on. Her hair caught in the brush, and she
clutched it in front of her. She came at last to the
edge of the clearing and staggered across it. There
were lights in the cabins, in her own home, in Adette
Clamart's, in Dominique Beauvais's and half a dozen
others. But Simon's was dark. Yet she swayed
toward that, hopeful to the last&mdash;and almost at the
door she came upon Simon. He was rigid and still,
like a shadow. She could see his gray, hard face.
Then he heard her panting, heard her trying to gasp
out her terrible news, and his arms reached out and
gathered her to him&mdash;and she told him what had
happened to Peter.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Simon was leaving in a sailboat.</p>

<p>"It's so dark Curry won't see me when I pass
through the mouth of the inlet," he said. "And I'll
reach Peter in half an hour."</p>

<p>Mona went back to McQuarrie's cabin, climbed to
Peter's room and lighted a lamp. In a cedar box
she found Peter's thirty-eight-caliber automatic and
loaded it with skilful fingers. Then she extinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the light, descended the ladder and left the cabin in
the direction of her tryst with Aleck Curry. There
was only one thing for her to do, and her mind was
quite fixed. It was her right to be at the end of the
point waiting for Simon and Peter. And if Aleck
threatened her&mdash;or put his hands on her again&mdash;she
would kill him. That was the one way out. It would
save Peter, and Peter's father, and herself.</p>

<p>It was not a monstrous thing but a just and
righteous act&mdash;this wiping out of existence of a
creature who threatened to destroy everything that
made her world a fit place to live in.</p>

<p>She had nearly passed the Clamart cabin when a
white figure ran out of the gloom, and she had only
time to hide the pistol in her dress when Adette
Clamart was holding her excitedly by the arm.
Adette's lovely face was white, and she was half out
of breath from running.</p>

<p>"It is terrible!" she cried. "Jame says the fire will
be at your beaver pond within an hour, and he has
just started in that direction with Jeremie Poulin and
Carter&mdash;to keep it from coming over the last
ridge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Carter!" gasped Mona.</p>

<p>"Yes. Jame told him about the cabin Peter built,
and Carter said it was a shame not to save it, and the
beavers. Jame says it is impossible&mdash;that a hundred
men couldn't keep the fire back&mdash;but Carter insisted,
and they've gone!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Mona tried to force words from her lips, and
thanked God that Adette hurried on, crying back to
her that she was making an effort to overtake Jame
before he got out of the clearing, to give him a lunch
which he had forgotten. Carter had returned&mdash;and
was on his way to the cabin in which Peter's father
was hidden! And that cabin, Jame said, would be in
the heart of the fire within an hour! With Peter dead
or wounded on the island, and Simon gone, what hope
was there now for Donald McRae? If the fire did not
reach his cabin first, Carter would get him, and if the
fire beat out Carter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mona's dry lips gave a little cry. Through the pitch-filled
evergreen forest about the beaver pond the fire
would sweep in a destroying inundation which no
living creature could outrace if the wind was behind
it; and Donald McRae, sick and helpless, would be the
first human victim in its descent upon Five Fingers.</p>

<p>The peril which was threatening Peter's father
from two directions worked a swift and thrilling
change in Mona. She must beat out Carter&mdash;and she
must beat out the fire! Thought of Aleck Curry
became secondary to this more immediate necessity.
She could settle with Aleck later. But she must reach
the cabin <i>now</i>. There was not a minute or a second
to lose if she was to get there ahead of Jame and
Carter. She began to run again, following a path
through the meadow into the strip of forest between
the settlement and the shore of the lake. Her feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and Peter's had worn this trail smooth, and she knew
that in the thickening gloom of smoke and night she
was traveling faster than Carter and Jame Clamart,
who were going by the rougher tote-road. In ten minutes
she reached the cliff which ran westward along
the lake.</p>

<p>Here she was high, and there were no trees to shut
out her view of the ridge country. What she saw
appalled her. Nowhere in the north was there any
longer a wall of blackness. The world was red, with
lurid flashings that came and went like mighty
explosions. Westward, beyond the beaver pond, she
could see the leaping of the flames in the thick spruce
and cedar timberlands where ten thousand barrels of
pitch and resinous oils were turning sleeping forests
into boiling caldrons of fire. The smell of this oil
and pitch was heavy in her nostrils, and she could hear
the moaning, distant roar of the conflagration as one
hears the roar of great furnaces when the fuel doors
are opened. But it was the wind that brought quicker
fear to her heart. It was beginning to blow strongly
from the north and west, and carried with it a heat
that was stifling. And with this heat and wind came
also a thickening cloud of ash particles, until at last,
afraid of their increasing sting, she stopped to take
off her skirt and fasten it about her hair and face.</p>

<p>Halfway to the pond, with still another mile to go,
she saw the flames leaping over the last ridge, and her
heart seemed suddenly to give way in a sobbing cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of agony and despair. She was too late. Between
that ridge and Peter's father was less than a mile of
spruce and cedar and balsam forest, with pitch-sodden
jackpines interspersed so thickly that no power less
than God could hold back the speed of the holocaust.
With the wind that was behind them the flames would
be at the cabin before she could cover a quarter of the
distance to Peter's father.</p>

<p>For a few moments she sank down helpless and
without strength, sobbing for breath as she stared at
the merciless red death which had beaten her&mdash;and
Carter. And in these moments her agony was greater
than when Aleck had told her about Peter, for now
she was picturing a man, creeping out on his hands and
knees to face that sea of flame&mdash;a man, sick and helpless,
crying out for Peter, for her, and dying by inches
with their names on his lips.</p>

<p>She staggered to her feet and went on, and in her
dazed mind lived a prayer that Donald McRae might
be given strength to drag himself to the shore of the
lake. If that strength had not already come to him, it
was now too late, for as she toiled over a high and
craggy point in the cliff the wind blew hot in her face,
and where the beaver pond should be was a red hell
of flames.</p>

<p>The trail descended as she forced herself on&mdash;descended
from the ramparted ledge to the smooth,
sandy level of the beach, and suddenly she was conscious
of the crashing of bodies in the thickets and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
frenzied sound of living things. A great moose
swept so near her that she sprang from his path&mdash;a
monstrous beast with flaming eyes and snorting
nostrils, closely followed by a darker, rounder object
that she knew was a bear, racing for the safety of the
water. She came to the sandy open where the trail
swung straight ridgeward toward the beaver pond,
and stopped, knowing she could go no farther unless
she defied the death from which all other living
creatures were flying.</p>

<p>Piteously Mona cried out&mdash;to Peter, to Simon, to
Donald McRae, and then to God; and at last she fell
down with her face buried in her skirt, ready to welcome
death itself in this hour when not only her
world but all that she loved in it were doomed to
destruction.</p>

<p>It was a sound close to her that uncovered her face,
a sound that came strangely above the moaning roar
of heat-wind and flame, and staring through the
gloom and against the red glare of the burning
forests, she saw a grotesque shadow&mdash;something that
was not moose nor deer nor any four-footed thing she
had ever seen in the wilderness; and rising up before
it she saw that it was a man bent under a huge, limp
burden which he carried. She cried out, and a choking
voice answered her&mdash;a strange, terrible, unhuman
sort of voice, yet the sound of it nearly split her heart,
and when the figure deposited its burden in the white
sand and stood up she saw that it was Peter. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
stumbled toward him. His arms caught her, and she
could hear him sobbing under the strain of his fight,
and his heart was beating so hard that each throb of
it sent a tremor through his body. In his weakness
her own strength returned, and in a moment her
hands had left his face and she was at the side of the
man who lay upon the sand.</p>

<p>It was Donald McRae. Now a great light was
flaming in the sky over their heads, and she saw that
his face and hands were black, and his eyes were closed,
though he was breathing. She tore the skirt from
about her head and ran to soak it in water, but when
she returned Peter was kneeling beside his father, and
held back the dripping cloth.</p>

<p>"Not water," he said. "We must get&mdash;something
else. He is burned."</p>

<p>She put her arms about Peter, and his face rested
for a moment on her shoulder. In that moment he
told her that Aleck had tricked him, and had left him
on the island. With the aid of a piece of dry driftwood
he had managed to swim ashore, but too late to
reach the cabin ahead of the flames. He found his
father halfway to the lake, fighting his way on hands
and knees in the van of the fire. His face and hands
were badly burned, but that was all. Another minute
and he would have been too late. His voice choked,
and Mona's hand stroked his face gently, and she
kissed his hot forehead.</p>

<p>Then they carried Donald McRae under the shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of the cliff, where they were free from smoke and heat,
with the water rippling in and out among the stones
at their feet. And here Mona told Peter of Aleck's
coming to the point, though she kept to herself what
happened there, and that Simon McQuarrie had gone
to the island in a sailboat and would surely come
straight to this beach when he found Peter gone. And
as they made Donald easier, and waited in the coolness
of the cliff for the fire-storm to burn itself out, she
told him also of Carter and that no time must be lost
in getting away to a place of greater safety.</p>

<p>Peter knew what that meant as he bent over his
father. In scarcely more than a whisper he told Mona.
He, too, must go. It would not be for long&mdash;maybe a
week, a month, or a little longer. It was not for himself.
He was not afraid of either Aleck or the law,
because he had done at the pool just what he would do
again if it were before the eyes of the whole world.
But his father needed him, and never would his heart
beat the same, nor would she ever again look at him
with a bit of the pride and love which made him so
strong, if he failed to do what was right in this hour.
Without him his father was lost. He hoped Simon
would come with the boat, for in that boat they would
escape into the wilderness farther west.</p>

<p>Mona made no answer to these things, for it was
hard enough for her to breathe with the thickness
that was in her throat. But her hand stroked Peter's,
and her cheek lay against his, and above the grief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
her breast rose a great pride in this man who loved her.
And a thought came to her of Sir Nigel, the chivalrous
young knight who looked so much like this Peter
of hers with his sensitive boyish face, and of how Mary
so bravely sent him away to the great wars in which
through long years he rose to undying fame; and she
subdued her heart, as Sir Nigel's sweetheart must have
conquered her own, and at last told Peter it was the
thing to do&mdash;the one thing to do&mdash;and that God and she
would love him for it. And even as she did this there
was creeping over her an unutterable foreboding, and
death seemed to pierce her heart when she heard Simon
McQuarrie's boat grounding on the sand. But she
smiled, and kissed Peter&mdash;and then Simon stood before
them. And in another five minutes he was gone again&mdash;this
time to the settlement for the supplies and medicines
which would go with Peter and his father.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For an hour they were alone, and Donald McRae
tried to keep back the moans of pain that came to his
lips. But he could not open his eyes, and Mona fanned
him gently with a piece of her wet skirt, and told him
Simon was hurrying with ointments which would make
him comfortable. Peter even laughed and spoke of
the sudden on-sweep of the fire as if it were an exciting
adventure, and it was good that Donald could not see
their tense and grief-filled faces in the gloom.</p>

<p>The fire roared through the last of the evergreens
and burned itself out against the bare stone knolls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
ledges of the lake shore. And then came again the
sound of Simon's boat on the sand.</p>

<p>"Carter has returned to the settlement and was preparing
to come this way in a boat when I slipped out
through the inlet," Simon whispered to Mona.</p>

<p>With Peter she went to the boat, leaving Simon
alone for a few moments with his old friend. And it
was Simon who came at the end of a brief interval
bearing the burden of Peter's father in his arms. Very
tenderly he laid him on the blankets in the boat.</p>

<p>"God be with you, Donald," he whispered, a broken
note in his voice. "God be with you&mdash;always."</p>

<p>The stricken man raised a burned hand to the other's
face.</p>

<p>"They have always been with me, Simon," he whispered
back. "God&mdash;and Helen. And now that you
have made such a fine man of Peter I hope I may go
to them&mdash;soon."</p>

<p>In the darkness Mona crept out of Peter's arms.</p>

<p>"Peter, you must wait no longer. You must go."</p>

<p>"In a little while I will come back, <i>Ange</i>."</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;by the sweet spirit of Ste. Anne&mdash;I promise
to be waiting for you when you come, Peter&mdash;though
I wait until new forests grow where yours and
mine have burned. So go&mdash;good-by&mdash;lover&mdash;sweetheart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then she had slipped away from him and he
made no effort to follow her into the smoky gloom,
though a sobbing cry came back to him faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment Simon stood aside with Peter. Their
hands gripped in the darkness and a strain was in the
old Scotchman's low voice as he said:</p>

<p>"I've put ointment on your father's face and hands
and he is easier. I don't think he is badly burned.
Everything is in the boat, lad&mdash;provisions, blankets,
medicines, a pack and what money I had at hand." He
hesitated and the grip of his fingers tightened as he
added: "In the bow is your rifle with extra ammunition
in the buckskin sack beside it. You'll need it. But
don't fight the law unless they force you to it, boy.
Remember that. The law finds no excuse, even though
scoundrels like Aleck Curry and blood-sucking ferrets
like Carter are sometimes a part of it. And let me tell
you that I saw with my own eyes when your father
killed a man years ago when you were a baby in your
mother's arms. It was for your mother he did it and
he was right; but in spite of that the law won't rest until
it lands him. And it's your job now to beat the law,
but without the use of a gun. I love you, lad&mdash;but
I'd curse you for a coward if you didn't do what you're
doing now. For years you and Mona have prayed that
God would send your father back to you&mdash;and now he
has come&mdash;and it's God's will behind it. All that is left
in a body that was once stronger than my own is his
worship for you and his memories of your mother.
Take care of him, Peter. And&mdash;God bless you both!"</p>

<p>Never had the iron-natured old Scotchman said so
much in all the years since Peter had come to live with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
him as a son. And without a word Peter went to the
boat, for his throat was thick and choking, and Simon
shoved the craft out into the sea until he was waist-deep
in the water. Simply he said good-by as if Peter
were going only to the nets or the islands outside the
mainland, and no tremor in his hard, calm voice betrayed
the tears on his cheeks which darkness hid. And
as Peter raised the sail McQuarrie waded ashore and
was met by a pair of arms and a sobbing voice that
cried out in its grief and despair against his shoulder.</p>

<p>Another sound came before they turned to the cliff
trail that led along the unburned shore of the lake to
Five Fingers. From the direction of the settlement
a light skiff bore down swiftly upon the strip of sandy
beach.</p>

<p>Carter, who sat in the stern, was old in the service of
the provincial police, a ferret on the trail, a fox in his
cleverness, cold-blooded, unexcitable and merciless&mdash;and
when the bow of the skiff ran into the sand and
Aleck Curry leaped ashore he remained quietly in his
seat and waited. In a moment he heard voices&mdash;the
cold, unemotional voice of the Scotchman first and then
Aleck Curry's in fierce demand and Mona Guyon's in
answer. He went ashore, his thin, hard face smiling in
the darkness, and heard Simon tell Aleck that the law
no longer had a work to do at Five Fingers, for Peter
and his father had died somewhere out in the heart of
the fire. He heard Mona's sob, close to Simon's shoulder.
Then he opened his flashlight, but not upon them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
It illumined Aleck's face, thick-lipped and bestial in its
disappointment and passion.  What he saw was amusing
to a man like Carter and a spark of chivalry made
him leave the others in darkness. But he stepped back
and cast his light upon the wet sand of the shore. And
then he said quite casually, as if his discovery was a
matter of small significance:</p>

<p>"You lie, McQuarrie! We have come only a quarter
of an hour too late. Peter McRae and his father have
gone in your boat, and as this breath of wind will
scarcely fill a sail, I think Aleck's enthusiasm and a
light skiff should make it possible for us to overtake
them within an hour!"</p>

<p>He chuckled as he switched off his flashlight, and that
chuckle was like the rattle of a snake to Mona, deadlier
than all the hate and animal passion she had seen in
Aleck Curry's face in the one swift moment when it
had flashed out of the darkness into light. For Carter
was more than a representative of the law. He was its
incarnation, and more than Aleck Curry&mdash;more than
any other man in the world&mdash;she feared him now as the
skiff sped in the direction taken by Peter and his father.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few minutes after leaving the shore Peter
did not trust himself to speak. He could see
nothing but a gray chaos except landward, where the
red sky and the darker blot of the cliff were visible
through the smoke gloom. Even the weather-stained
canvas of Simon's boat was indistinguishable, and
where his father lay on a pile of blankets at his feet
he could make out only a shadow. Now that the fire
had burned itself out of the forests between the shore
and the ridges the heated winds gave way quickly to a
growing calm. The smoke hung like a dense fog and
with this change came a strange stillness in which
sound seemed to multiply itself until he heard clearly
the wailing of a dog at Five Fingers.</p>

<p>Then the faint rattle of oarlocks came to him and his
hand tightened on the tiller. It was Aleck Curry again&mdash;Aleck
and the man-hunter, Carter, hurrying to cut
them off before they could leave the shore! And suddenly
in fierce passion he wanted to shout back his defiance
to them just as years ago&mdash;three days before he
came to Five Fingers&mdash;he had felt the desire to kill
the men who had driven his father into the forest.
Something in these moments brought that day back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
him&mdash;a vivid memory of the big log behind which they
were sheltered, and armed men in the thickets, the blue
jay screeching at them, his thirst and hunger and his
father's pale, strong face waiting with courage for
darkness to come; then the dusk, their escape on a log
in the flooded river and their first fugitive camp in the
big woods. How wonderful his father had been in
those hours of peril which he as a boy could scarcely
understand! And now he was lying at his feet, a pitiable
wreck because of that same merciless and unfair
law which had pursued him then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Peter cried out. It was not much more than a throat
sound, as if the smoke had made him gasp for breath.
But a hand rose out of the darkness and touched him.</p>

<p>"Peter!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dad."</p>

<p>"It has all gone wrong, boy. If only I hadn't been
so heartsick to see you&mdash;if I had never come back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter bent over and his hand rested tenderly against
the face which Simon had cooled with ointment.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't come I'd have lost all faith in the
God you used to tell me about," he whispered. "I
wanted to give up but Mona wouldn't let me. She
said you would surely come. And this isn't half as
bad as that day behind the log when I was a little kid.
Remember how you cared for me then&mdash;kept me above
water when we went into the river, caught rabbits for
me to eat afterward and tucked me into bed every night
near the camp-fire? Well, it's <i>my</i> turn now. And I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
almost glad you're sick&mdash;just so I can show you how
much I've grown up since that afternoon you sent me
on alone to Five Fingers so many years ago. You lied
to me then, dad. You made me believe you'd come back
that night, or the next day. Haven't you ever been
ashamed of that?"</p>

<p>The strain was gone from his voice. It was his <i>dad</i>
he was speaking to again, his pal and comrade of the
old days, and the thrill of that comradeship was stirring
warmly in his blood.</p>

<p>"I knew Simon would give you a good home,"
said Donald. "And he has made a splendid man of you.
But I'm sorry, Peter&mdash;sorry I came back. After all
those years I was hungry to see you. I just wanted
to look on your face and then go away again without
letting you know. I didn't mean to break into your
life like this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His hand was stroking Peter's and for a moment
Peter bent down until his face was close to his father's.
Donald was silent but his hand continued its caressing
touch. After a little he said:</p>

<p>"Did I hear something, Peter?"</p>

<p>"I think it was thunder. A storm must be following
in the trail of the fire."</p>

<p>"I mean out there&mdash;near at hand. It was like wood
striking on wood."</p>

<p>He sank back and Peter reached down and made his
head comfortable. "This makes me think of that last
night in the woods when you tucked me in my cedar-bough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
bed and told me to sleep," he whispered gently.
"And I'm telling you that now, dad. It's what you
need. Try and sleep!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he heard the distant sound again
and knew it was the clank of oarlocks. He fastened the
tiller so that Simon's boat was heading for the open
sea. Then he crept forward and returned with a
blanket, and this blanket he quietly unfolded in the
darkness, taking from it the weapon which Simon had
loaded and placed there for his use. And Simon's
words were running over and over in his head, as steady
as the ticking of a clock. "Take care of him, Peter.
It's your job now to beat the law."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the minutes passed it seemed to Peter that sound
became a living, stealthy part of the night, creeping
about him in ghostly whispers, hiding behind the canvas
sail, rustling where the water moved under the bow,
purring at his feet and in the air. This impression of
sound by its smallness and its secretiveness served to
emphasize the hush which had fallen upon a burned
and blasted world. Its muteness bore with it a quality
of solemnity and a quickening thrill as if subjugated
forces were muffled and bound and might unleash themselves
without warning. In this stillness Peter heard
the thunder creeping up faintly behind the path of fire.
But the sound of the oar did not come again.</p>

<p>He strained his eyes to pierce the gloom even though
he knew the effort was futile and senseless. The red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
line of the fire was steadily receding. In places it was
lost. Where he had left the cliff and the sandy strip
of beach was a black chaos, and it was this darkness
with its silence which seemed to reach into his heart
and choke him with its oppression and foreboding.</p>

<p>Through the stillness a sound came to him, floating
softly over the sea, sweet and distant. His fingers
slowly unclasped and he bowed his head. It was the
bell over the little church of logs and Father Albanel
was tolling it. Even now in this smoke-filled hour of
the night he was calling the people of the settlement
together that they might offer up in prayer their gratitude
because homes and loved ones had been spared
by the red death that had swept the land. It was like
a living voice, gently sweet and soothing as it brought
him faith and reverence. <i>There was a God!</i> Every
fiber in his body leaped to that cry of his heart. Without
a God his father would have died, the whole world
would have burned, there would be no Mona, no hope,
no anything for him in the darkness of the freedom
which lay ahead. His lips moved with Mona's prayer
and he stood up quietly so that he might hear more
clearly until the last peal of the bell died away. And
when the gray silence shut him in again he felt as if a
protecting spirit had come to ride with him in the
gloom.</p>

<p>Softly he spoke to his father but there was no answer.
Exhaustion and the peace of the open sea had overcome
the stricken man and he was asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Encumbered by stillness and smoke, the night passed
with appalling slowness. The distant thunder with its
promise of rain died away. Half a dozen times Peter
lighted matches and looked at his watch. At last it was
three o'clock and the horizon of murk and smoke that
shut him in receded as dawn advanced. Then came a
sudden keen breeze, like the last sweeping of a great
broom, and he could see the coast. His own heart was
thrilled by the sight of it, for behind the menacing headland
of barren rock that rose like a great gargoyle hundreds
of feet above the lower cliff was a strip of water
which he had once hazarded in a dead calm and which
led back half a mile between towering walls of rock and
naked ridges into that very chaos of wildness which
he had wanted for a hiding-place.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this moment of exultation possessed
him when the wind died again. At the same time a
clearer light diffused itself over the sea. The horizon
drew itself back like a curtain and half a mile away
he saw an object that sent his heart into his throat.</p>

<p>For a few moments he neither moved nor seemed
to breathe as he stared at a swiftly approaching skiff.
Then he looked at his father. Donald McRae had not
awakened. A livid scar lay across his eyes as if a red-hot
iron had burned out his sight. His hands were
blistered, his lips were swollen and his neck and shoulders
were scarred and covered with the ointment which
Simon had used. Yet&mdash;even then&mdash;<i>his father slept</i>!
The horror of it choked Peter and his soul cried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
for vengeance against those who had made this wreck
of a man. He turned and his hand rested upon his
rifle. He no longer feared the law or Aleck Curry or
Carter, the ferret. His desire at first was to kill them.
With astonishing calmness he waited, watching the
approaching skiff. When it was two hundred yards
away he picked up his rifle.</p>

<p>He chose the small of Aleck's back for his first shot
and raised his gun. In the same moment he observed
that with Carter in the stern and Aleck amidships the
bow of the skiff was high out of water. It was this
situation which saved Aleck and Peter's first bullet
crashed through the boat an inch or two below the
water line. He followed with two other shots. The
effect was almost instantaneous. Aleck Curry lurched
away from the oars and the skiff came within an ace of
upsetting. In another moment the quick-witted Carter
had called Aleck into the stern and there both crouched,
their combined weight raising the shattered bow above
the water line while Carter stripped himself of his
shirt.</p>

<p>The shots roused Donald, and with an effort he drew
himself up beside Peter.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he demanded. He turned his scarred
face toward Peter and then with a strange cry covered
his face with his hands. "My God, I can't see!" he
cried. "Peter&mdash;I can't see!"</p>

<p>In that darkest moment of his life Peter thanked God
the wind came and filled the sail of Simon's boat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that neither Carter nor Aleck Curry shouted after them
or made a sound that his father might hear, and like
an inspiration a lie came to his lips&mdash;he had done some
poor shooting at a flock of mallards! He spoke cheerfully
of his father's efforts to see, telling him it would
be days before he could hope for vision when his eyes
were swollen and scarred by burns. And Donald,
seeing nothing of the agony in Peter's bloodless face,
smiled cheerfully up at the clearing sky in spite of his
pain. He did not mind so much about his hands, he
said, but it was a hardship to have his eyes covered as
Peter was bandaging them now because he wanted to
see as much as he could of his boy in the short time
they would be together. There was a note of happiness
in his voice which was in strange contrast to the pathos
of his appearance and his helplessness.</p>

<p>And Peter fought to keep up that spirit of cheer and
of gladness that was in Donald McRae's heart. But
his own heart was breaking&mdash;for he knew that his
father was blind.</p>

<p>Hours later Simon's boat came stealing back to shore
in the sunless dusk of the evening. This time the sail
was down and with muffled oars Peter rowed cautiously
for the break in the cliff. Blended with the deepening
shadows of the sea, he worked his boat into the narrow
maw of the crevasse whose rock walls rose two hundred
feet over their heads. In utter darkness, with the thin
streak of light far above, he felt his way for half an
hour. Then the fissure widened and after another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
fifteen minutes of slow progress its walls bulged outward,
losing themselves in the gloom, and ahead
stretched the hidden inlet, smothered on all sides by
precipitous crags and cliffs and towering forest ridges.</p>

<p>On a narrow strip of sand he grounded the boat and
lighted the lantern which Simon had placed in the
outfit. Its illumination threw up grimly the black shadows
about them, and questing among these, he found
huge masses of torn and twisted rocks so wildly thrown
together that among them were many little caverns and
grottoes thickly carpeted with white sand. One of
these he chose for a camp, but not until he had gathered
an armful of bleached driftwood and had started
a fire did he return to the boat. It was then, in the
yellow light of flaming cedar and pine, that he noted a
strange and startling change had come over his father.
Donald McRae no longer bore the appearance of a sick
man. He stood straight and was breathing deeply.
His lips were smiling as he faced Peter and quite
calmly he removed the bandage from his eyes.</p>

<p>"At last we are home," he spoke softly. "And just
beyond you&mdash;<i>I see your mother</i>!" Instantly he seemed
to sense the shock of those words to Peter, for he said:
"Don't let that frighten you, lad. Every day and night
she is at my side. Only&mdash;now&mdash;<i>she is nearer</i>!"</p>

<p>He reached out his hands and almost fiercely Peter's
arms closed about him.</p>

<p>Donald stroked his hair. It was the old caress, and
he spoke to Peter as if to a little boy again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're not afraid, Peter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter's heart stopped beating.</p>

<p>"They can't hurt you," said Donald soothingly. "I
won't let them do that, Peter."</p>

<p>Peter drew slowly away. His face was gray in the
firelight and in his eyes was a growing horror. He
tried to speak but no words came from his lips. Donald's
scarred face was strangely tranquil. It seemed
to Peter that years had dropped away from it. In it
was no fear, no sign of strain, no consciousness of the
terrible hours they had passed through or of the tragic
future which lay ahead. And the truth came to Peter,
a suspicion at first, a whisper, growing and overwhelming
him until at last it was a dizzying sickness that set
him swaying on his feet. In this hour Donald McRae
was not the man who had returned after years of wandering
to see his boy. His mind had gone back. It
had returned to the days of Peter's childhood and his
voice was repeating words almost forgotten&mdash;a sacred
promise of days when Peter had built mighty castles in
the air and his father had helped him plan them with
the understanding smile that was on his lips now.</p>

<p>For he was saying: "They won't hurt a boy, Peter.
We'll get away. And then we'll go through the big
woods to the mountains just as we've always wanted
to do."</p>

<p>Peter raised clenched hands to his face to stifle his
agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>In the torturing slowness of the hours which followed
Donald McRae lived again in the precious years
when Peter was a boy, recalling forgotten incidents
as if they had happened yesterday, bringing forth their
old dreams, painting their pictures of the future as he
had done so often with Peter at his side in the afterglow
of evenings long ago. And Peter, with his soul torn
and bleeding, talked with him. Together they were
hunting again. They followed the old trap-lines. They
heard the song of birds and planted seeds and flowers
in the little garden back of their cabin home, and Peter
was kneeling at his father's knees when he said his
prayers at night. These things Peter had dreamed of
and treasured in his years at Five Fingers, but now
they were horrors&mdash;coming out of the past with a voice
that trembled with the thrill and joy of a strange madness.</p>

<p>At last Donald slept. It was after midnight and the
last embers of the fire had burned out. Peter rose
to his feet and walked up the shore, staring into darkness.
The rock walls that inclosed the inlet rose sheer
above him, making of the place a deep and sombrous
pit. He could see the stars and their distance lent an
abysmal solitude to the gloom. About him was no
movement and no stir of life; the water lay still; no
whisper came from dark forests on the ridge tops; the
black walls were dead and in the soft sand his feet
alone disturbed the sepulchral quiet.</p>

<p>To Peter this strangeness seemed naturally a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of the change that had come into his life. Everything
was changed. His world had gone into atoms and now
it was reassembling itself; and with deadened emotions,
almost dully, he was beginning to accept it. His yesterdays,
it seemed, had existed an infinitely long time ago.
Five Fingers was no longer home or a necessity and
even Mona seemed a vast distance away from him in
these hours when his own soul was remolding itself to
fit the grimness of a new existence. His mind no longer
questioned the path he was to take and no shadow of
revolt rose in it.</p>

<p>One thought was as steadfastly fixed in him now as
life itself. He belonged to his father and his father belonged
utterly to him. He must go on with him, care
for him, fight for him, save him from that one dread
brutality of the law if his own life paid the forfeit in
the end. That was settled. Even his love for Mona
could not change that duty and older love which urged
him. It was more than a resolution; it was as immutably
a part of him as the beating of his heart and his
own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>The stars faded and day broke swiftly above the
walls of the inlet. He returned and found his father
on his hands and knees groping in the sand. He was
gathering sticks and placing them with the remnants
of last night's fire, and when he heard Peter's footsteps
he paused in his labor and raised a face out of
which once more the years of grief and hopelessness
seemed to have gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you hungry, Peter?" he asked.</p>

<p>And Peter, as he knelt beside him, knew that he was
speaking to Peter the boy and not to Peter the man.</p>

<p>Together they built the fire.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nine</span> days Peter and his father spent in their
hiding-place under the walls of the lagoon. At
the end of that time Donald's burns were healed and
his strength had returned. He had taken on flesh and
his shoulders were straighter. His eyes were clear
again but their vision was strangely shadowed and at
a hundred yards the wall of the lagoon was like a dark
curtain. For a time it was impossible for Peter to
believe that his father's mind was not keeping pace
with his physical revivement. Yet with the passing of
each day Donald's mental grip concentrated itself more
and more on the past until he seemed not to have lived
at all beyond those years when Peter was a boy. Together
they picked up old threads as if they had never
been broken or lost, and in those occasional dark and
brooding intervals when Donald's mind dragged itself
back into the haunting tragedy of the present Peter
found himself praying for the return of that partial
amnesia which at first had terrified him.</p>

<p>On the evening of the ninth day Peter once more set
out to sea. Fifty miles westward he ran ashore in the
illusive, gray dusk of morning and burned Simon's
boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that their flight northward had actually begun
there were moments when his father's attitude almost
frightened him. At first Donald's mind was keenly
alive to the nearness of danger and in his half blindness
he became more watchful and alert than Peter. But
it was the peril of years ago that haunted him&mdash;the
menace of the men who had driven them from their
cabin home and who had nearly killed them when Peter
was a boy.</p>

<p>After the third day Peter began to mark the beginning
of the final change in his father. Donald became
less watchful and sounds no longer seemed to disturb
him. Instincts which warned him of peril became
ghosts and at last faded away entirely. By the end of
the seventh day there remained only one consciousness
of living in Donald's soul; Peter was his little boy, and
he was with Peter. Physically he betrayed no sign that
his mind had crumbled. His scarred eyes, in which
vision had grown even dimmer, held in them a deep and
abiding clearness and a strange gentleness grew in his
face. And Peter, holding tight to keep his own heart
from breaking, knew what it meant. His father was
forgetful of all things now but his boy, and was happy.</p>

<p>This change more than anything else killed in Peter's
breast his last hope of returning to Five Fingers. Sheer
madness with its darkness and its misery might have
driven him back to Simon and Father Albanel, taking
Donald McRae to asylum doors instead of to the hangman.
But this which he saw growing in his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
was to him a quietly working miracle of God instead
of breaking down of body and soul and brain.</p>

<p>As day followed day and one cool, dark night added
itself to another, a warm and thrilling reaction came
to replace with new emotions the gloom and desolation
in his heart. Not for an hour did he stop thinking
of Mona; her face was with him, her voice, the touch
of her lips and hands; she walked with him in the thick
aisles of the forest, slept near his side at night, wakened
with him in the morning and became in each increasing
hour of their separation more completely a part of him.
But with this thought of her returned also the old passion
of his childhood&mdash;his love for his father. His
heart stirred strangely to the gentle caress of Donald's
hand as it had thrilled when he was a boy. The old
chumship rose out of its ashes, smoldered for a while
and then burned steadily as if the broken years had
never been. Home, mother, father, all the joys and
dreams of childhood and early boyhood crept upon
him a little at a time, until at last he knew that to sacrifice
his father was as unthinkable as to surrender that
part of his heart which Mona filled.</p>

<p>Between these two loves, encouraged on one side by
duty and on the other by desire, lay his grief. Until
the end of the third week he did not give up fully his
resolution to send word back to Mona. By that time
the hazard of such an act had fully impressed itself
upon him. He no longer feared Aleck Curry, whose
stupidity he had fully measured, but almost as frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
as Mona filled his mind came also dread of
Carter. A cold and abiding fear of this man entered
into him and he was confident it would not be long
before this human ferret of the forests would in some
way find their trail. At times he was oppressed by the
feeling that Carter was close behind them and he tried
to establish in his mind the certainty of his action if
his father's enemy should suddenly appear. Thought
of what might happen&mdash;what probably would happen&mdash;made
him shudder. For there could be no halfway
measures with Carter now.</p>

<p>Always on the alert, with his rifle never far from
reach of his hands, he swung still farther north and
west. Autumn found him in the Dubaunt River country,
and the beginning of winter on the Thelon. Here
he traded his watch in a Dogrib camp for a score of
traps, blankets and new moccasins, invested the last of
his money in flour, sugar, salt and tea, and took possession
of an abandoned cabin in the neighborhood of
Hinde Lake. All through the winter he trapped and set
deadfalls and snares.</p>

<p>A hundred times during the long winter he fought
against his desire to send a word to Mona. Months
had not dulled his caution and as soon as the spring
break-up made it possible to travel he led his father into
the Artillery Lake country. Through the spring and
early summer they were constantly on the move, always
making a little southward. By the time August came
they had completed two-thirds of an immense circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and south of the Athabasca country found themselves
in the unmapped region between the Cree River and
the McFarland. Here, in a country of ridges and
swamps and deep forests, Peter made up his mind that
at last they were safely hidden from Carter and all the
rest of the world.</p>

<p>He breathed easier and began the building of a
cabin. This was on a dark-watered, silent little stream,
with a vast swamp at their back door, ridge country
to right and left of them and an illimitable forest reaching
out in front. The nearest point of habitation that
Peter knew of was a Hudson's Bay Company post
sixty miles away.</p>

<p>And this cabin with each log that went into it became
a closer and more inseparable part of Donald McRae.
Out of that forgetfulness which could scarcely be called
madness began to creep memories so warm and vivid
that they seemed to breathe with life itself. For Donald
was building the old home again, the home of Peter's
mother, where the moon had looked in through the
window on the night he was born&mdash;a home, sweet and
whispering with the presence of a woman one had worshiped
in the flesh and the other had visioned as an
angel in his dreams. After a little it was Donald and
not Peter who was building the cabin, and by the time
it was finished it seemed to Peter that a strange and
unseen spirit of life, gentle as prayer itself, had come
to dwell in it with them.</p>

<p>Autumn came again with its paradise of color. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
cedars, spruces and balsams took on a deeper, richer
green; each sunrise bathed the ridges of poplar and
birch in new splendor of red and yellow and gold; the
nights grew colder, the days were filled more and more
with the autumn tang that made blood run red and
warm. God was with them here. Donald said that, as
in the days of old. And Peter began to believe&mdash;and
as faith rose in him hope and dreams returned. <i>Mona's
prayer was answered</i>&mdash;the prayer they had said together
for years asking that his father might be returned to
him, and that they might all find refuge together somewhere
in the wilderness world which they loved. And
this was the refuge, given to them through the sweet
and charitable guidance of God. All that was needed
to complete it was Mona.</p>

<p>He began to thrill with a greater excitement as the
first snows came. Would it be safe to return for Mona
<i>now</i>? There were times when his whole soul cried
out in the affirmative and he was almost ready to begin
the long journey. But his caution never quite died and
he always pulled himself back in time. Sixteen months
had seemed an eternity to him but prudence warned him
not to hurry. He would wait until spring. By that
time, if Carter were on their trail, the climax would
surely come. If the winter passed safely, he would go
to Five Fingers and bring Mona back with him. Not
for a moment did he doubt she would come, and he
continued to add to the glorious castles he built in his
mind, shadowed only now and then by oppressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
thoughts of the many things which might have happened
at Five Fingers in almost two years of absence.</p>

<p>Late in February he left for the trading-post with
two Indian dogs and a light toboggan to sell his furs.
It was not unusual now for Donald to remain alone
for several days at a time, for Peter knew the home
they had built had become a part of his heart and soul
and that nothing short of actual force or his own
wishes and plans could drag his father from it. On
this trip to the post he expected to be gone five days.</p>

<p>It was very cold. Trees cracked and snapped with
the piercing bite of the frost and the snow crackled
underfoot. For a long time after Peter had disappeared
Donald stood in the little clearing staring over
the trail where his boy had gone.</p>

<p>Something unknown to Peter was finding its way
into Donald's brain. Through the night it had worked,
gnawing its way slowly and stealthily, and now that
Peter was gone it grew bolder. Even as he turned the
cabin took on a new aspect for Donald. Though the
sun was shining and the sky was clear, a shadow
seemed to have fallen over it and the welcoming spirit
which had always clasped him closely to its heart was
missing when he entered through the door. As the
day passed a change came in Donald's face. He was
restless and uneasy. Sounds startled him again. In
the dusk of evening he did not light a candle but sat
quietly in a corner, staring into darkness with his half-blind
eyes, and all that night he did not go to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day there was no sun; the sky was heavy
with gloom, the air thick and difficult for Donald to
breathe. Mysterious shadows crept about him and at
times he tried futilely to seize these with his hands. As
the hours passed his mind became more and more like
a broken limb from which the last prop had been taken.
A hundred times he whispered Peter's name. Then
came the beginning of the storm. It broke in mid-afternoon
and by night was a howling blizzard. In
darkness the cabin shook and the wind screamed overhead
and the snow beat like shot against the window.
It would be a long time before the forest people would
forget this storm because of its ferocity and the tragedy
which it left in its wake, but to Donald it was more
than a storm&mdash;it was a personal thing. In it was the
cumulative chaos of all the evils from which he had
been a fugitive through the years, and now, cornering
him at last, they were fighting to break through the
log walls of the cabin.</p>

<p>He built up the fire until it roared in the chimney
and lighted candles until the cabin was aflame with
light. And then, suddenly as a bolt of lightning, some
thing came to him. It was <i>voice</i>&mdash;voice screaming at
the window, voice howling over the roof logs, voice
moaning and wailing and dying away in the sweeping
of the wind. "<i>Peter!</i> <i>Peter!</i> <i>Peter!</i>" It was crying&mdash;nothing
but Peter's name, repeating it a thousand
times in its laughing, taunting, moaning efforts to make
him understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>A half-savage cry rose out of his breast. He was
not afraid, not when his boy needed him&mdash;and hatless
and coatless he flung up the birchwood bar to the door
and faced the storm.</p>

<p>"<i>Peter!</i>" he called. "<i>Peter!</i> <i>Peter!</i>"</p>

<p>It all had but one meaning for Donald now. The
storm had Peter. It was playing with him, killing him,
and these devils in the wind had come to tell him about
it in their glee. He could feel them clawing and
striking at his breast and face; the snow struck his
eyes like tiny spear points and he found it difficult to
get his breath in the face of the blast which tried to
overwhelm him. He called again as he fought his
way out into the blackness and snow. His words
drifted away in shreds, whipped to pieces by the wind.
Creatures seemed picking up handfuls of snow and
hurling it in his face&mdash;he could hear their swift movement,
the hissing of their breath, their evasion as he
struck out at them, and he called Peter's name louder
than before to give his boy courage and let him know
he was coming.</p>

<p>That Peter was near the cabin, that he had turned
back and was making a desperate fight to reach its shelter
was as firmly a part of Donald's mind as the
conviction that all the forces of the darkness and evil
were trying to keep him away from his boy.</p>

<p>His head was bare and his woolen shirt was unbuttoned
at the throat, but he did not sense the terrible
cold that came with the blizzard. Among the trees his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
feet found instinctively the beginning of the trail that
was blazed through the forest and he reached out his
naked hands and plunged knee-deep through windrows
of snow that lay in his way. The thickets whipped and
beat at him and branches, ambushed in darkness,
reached out from twisting trees to strike him, but he
did not feel sting or pain.</p>

<p>At last he was sure he heard an answer to his calling
but the wind came and roared in his ears and the snow
beat so fiercely in his face that he could not locate the
quarter from which it came. Then he tricked the wind.
He stumbled in the snow behind a tree and lay there
until a brief lull followed in the wake of it, when he
called again as loudly as he could. But he had the
direction of it now and a hundred paces brought him
to the edge of a rocky ravine which ran near the trail.
Down this he clambered and in the pit-like darkness at
the bottom found what he was seeking. Beside a figure
rumpled and twisted in the snow he fell upon his knees,
moaning Peter's name.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Donald came back to the light
in the clearing, staggering under the weight of his
burden. He opened the door and together the two
crashed in upon the floor. On his hands and knees
Donald turned and shut the door against the storm.
Then he crept to the younger man whose wide-open
eyes were staring at him from a thin, white, strangely
contorted face, and put his arms about him, holding his
head closely against his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're all right now, Peter," he comforted in a
broken, gasping voice. "You're all right&mdash;&mdash;" He
tried to laugh as his frozen fingers wiped the snow from
the other's hair. "We're home and it's warm and I'll
get something to eat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He crawled to the stove, almost crooning in his joy,
and opened the iron door to thrust in more wood.
The flames lighted up his face, bloodless from the cold
and wet with snow that had already begun to melt and
trickle down his cheeks to his bare neck and chest. His
hair glistened white&mdash;whiter, it seemed, than an hour
ago; his breath came huskily as if driven through a
sieve; he was a crumpled, frozen, wind-broken wreck,
and yet as he turned from the flaming door of the stove
to look at the man on the floor there was a strange
miracle of triumph and happiness riding over the torture
in his face and a smile was on his lips. The storm
might beat and howl outside and all the evils of darkness
might scream and rage to get in for all he cared
now. He had saved his boy!</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and stood swaying for a moment,
smiling, trying to speak. Then he fell upon a cot.</p>

<p>The man on the floor had pulled himself to his elbow.
He put a mittened hand to his throat as if to free
himself from fingers that were gripping him there.
His face too was bloodless. It was a thin face, driven
white and hard by exhaustion and pain. He was a man
who had been close to death and the shadow of it was
still in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew off his mittens and a foot at a time dragged
himself across the floor. When he reached the cot he
pulled himself up to it and put his arms over the
stricken form of the one who had saved him.</p>

<p>Donald felt the nearness and raised a hand weakly
to the other's face.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;Peter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me."</p>

<p>Donald's blue lips smiled.</p>

<p>"They didn't get us, did they, boy? We got away
from them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, we got away."</p>

<p>"And you're warm now&mdash;good and warm?"</p>

<p>The head over him bowed itself slowly until almost
reverently it touched Donald's breast. It was not
Peter's head. It was not Peter's voice that answered.
But Donald gave a deep sigh of contentment as his
fingers found a hand which he thought was Peter's
and for a time neither one nor the other spoke again,
while near them the fire crackled merrily in the stove
and the candles sputtered and flared as if laughing at
the storm which was lashing itself into a wailing madness
outside the cabin walls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For three days and nights no living creature could
stand against the storm which swept the Athabasca
country, nor could they travel in the intense cold which
followed in its wake.</p>

<p>It was the fifth of March, twelve days after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
left the cabin, before Peter crossed the Pipestone on
his return into the region where he and his father had
made their home.</p>

<p>His mind was a torment of unrest as he visioned
a hundred tragic happenings, any one of which might
have visited his father during his absence. The last
twenty-four hours he traveled without an hour of
sleep.</p>

<p>It was midday when he came to a high ridge from
which he could look down into a cup of the forest
where the cabin stood, a mile away. For the first time
he breathed easily when he saw a spiral of blue smoke
rising straight up into the clear sunshine of the day.</p>

<p>He laughed in his gladness as he came to the trail
which led past the spring near their home. He would
stop and drink there and then give the old-time halloo
for his father. He could see Donald hurrying through
the sunshine to welcome him as he heard that cry.</p>

<p>As he came round the last turn in the trail he stopped
suddenly. Someone was at the spring. The bent figure
was less than a hundred yards from him and he could
see it rising slowly, lifting a pail filled with water.
He shifted his rifle and made a megaphone of his mittened
hands at his mouth. It would be a rousing surprise
for his dad!</p>

<p>But the cry died before it reached his lips. The man
at the spring was not his father. Tall and thin and
hooded, and walking with a stick as he advanced, the
stranger came toward Peter. He progressed slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and with difficulty, limping with each step he took.
His head was bowed and not until they had approached
within a few paces of each other did he raise it so
that his face was clearly revealed. And then Peter
gave a startled cry and swift as a flash swung the
muzzle of his rifle upon the other.</p>

<p>"<i>Carter!</i>" he gasped.</p>

<p>A wan smile played over the ferret's face as he raised
a hand and thrust back his hood.</p>

<p>"My name is not Carter," he replied. "Since twelve
days ago I have been Peter McRae&mdash;Donald McRae's
son."</p>

<p>Something in his thin face and strangely sunken eyes
sent a cold chill to Peter's heart.</p>

<p>Carter had stopped with the muzzle of the rifle
touching the pit of his stomach. He made no effort to
thrust it aside but stood looking calmly into the
other's eyes.</p>

<p>"It happened just that long ago," he said. "I was
trailing you when I slipped over a ledge and almost
broke a leg among the rocks. The storm came and I
was about done for, when your father wandered out
into the night, calling your name, and I answered. He
got me into the cabin and I've been there ever since.
From the beginning he thought I was you. I understand
now, McRae. I know what I've done&mdash;and I
wish you would pull that trigger. I deserve it."</p>

<p>Peter lowered the gun.</p>

<p>"You have not harmed him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Harmed him!</i>" A dull look of agony filled Carter's
eyes as he turned slowly toward the cabin. "No, I
haven't harmed him&mdash;not since twelve days ago. It
was all done before that. Only God will ever know how
gentle and good he was to me, thinking I was you&mdash;and
if by dying I could return what I've taken away
from him I'd kill myself. And if I were in your place,
Peter&mdash;standing where you are&mdash;<i>I'd shoot</i>!"</p>

<p>He gave a stifled cry as Peter hurried past him. In
it was a note of appeal that choked and died in his
throat. But Peter did not hear it nor did he see fully
the look of dread that was in Carter's eyes. He unshouldered
his pack at the cabin door, laid his rifle beside it
and went in. He was no longer afraid of Carter.
Something tighter and more terrible was gripping at
his heart.</p>

<p>Carter came limping up the trail and when he reached
the door he bared his head and quietly followed Peter
into the cabin.</p>

<p>Peter was on his knees beside the bunk in which
Donald was lying. His arms were spread out and his
head was bowed upon Donald's breast.</p>

<p>White-faced, Carter knelt beside him and put both
his hands about his shoulders. "Until <i>he</i> brought me
into this cabin twelve days ago I never believed in God,"
he said huskily. "But I do now, Peter. For twelve
days <i>your father was my father</i>. I loved him. And I
know, if he could have understood, that from the beginning
he would have forgiven me&mdash;the man who hunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
him to his death. If by any merciful chance <i>you</i> can
do that, Peter&mdash;if you can find it in your heart to let
him remain my father and you my brother&mdash;&mdash;" One
of his hands found Peter's, clasping it tightly, and the
other crept to Donald's face, where it lay cold and lifeless
on its pillow. "In God's name say you forgive
me!" he whispered.</p>

<p>In answer Peter's fingers returned the pressure of
Carter's hand and a sob broke on the man-hunter's lips.</p>

<p>After a moment of silence he said: "It was the terrible
cold and exposure of that night in which he was
hunting for you. It reached his lungs. Until yesterday
I was not afraid. Then the change came&mdash;swiftly.
He died this morning, Peter, in <i>your</i> arms, and the last
word on his lips was <i>your</i> name&mdash;and Mona's."</p>

<p>A long time there was stillness in the cabin as the two
men knelt beside their dead.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the long days and weeks which followed Peter's
return to the cabin and the death of his father a
change which seemed to him a little short of a miracle
came over the man-hunter. The pitiless Carter, the
human ferret, whose years of duty had never been
tempered with mercy or conscience, was gone, and in
his place was a new Carter, dragging himself a little at
a time out of the paths of tragedy and misery which he
had followed for so long.</p>

<p>Through those years Peter knew that Carter had
been a Nemesis and a destroyer. He had not known
pity, but only the grim exultation of achievement.
Women, love, the extenuation of circumstance, even
motherhood in its most beautiful sacrifice, had not
stayed his hand when once the law had set him like a
hound upon the scent of his victim. He had broken
men and women. He had opened doors of blackness
and despair to a hundred human souls. Yet the law had
been always at his back, urging him on and exulting in
his triumphs; he had committed no crime, no sin, and
the world had applauded his exploits when it heard of
them, visioning him as a splendid part of that mighty
mechanism of legal force which made peace and good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
will on earth possible among men. Yet Carter, in these
strange days of his mental and spiritual transformation,
knew differently.</p>

<p>He knew that he had served too well, and for that
reason he hated himself, and called himself a fiend. It
was now, after he had hunted Peter's father to his
death, that his successes began to dig themselves out of
their graves and reappear to him as haunting ghosts.
And he prayed God to keep Peter, of all men, from hating
him.</p>

<p>"I killed your father," he said to him frankly. "I
hunted him until his mind and his body broke down
and he died. And in the end he accepted me as a son,
and I loved him. If I had only known! But I didn't,
and my life belongs to you. I give it willingly as the
price of a great mistake."</p>

<p>And as the sullen winter's end passed Peter found it
impossible to hate Carter. Instead, there grew in him
a slow and irresistible feeling of brotherhood for the
man who had trailed them to their hiding-place at last,
and who, in the hour of his deepest grief, had knelt
with him in prayer over the frozen grave of his father.
In those moments he had learned that it was not Carter
who was accountable. It was the system&mdash;the law and
its inalienable right to strike and kill.</p>

<p>Now, late in April, they were going home.</p>

<p>Six hundred miles behind them lay the wilderness of
the Pipestone and the McFarland, where the hunt had
ended and the final tragedy had been enacted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Ahead of them, beyond four hundred miles of still
deeper forests was Five Fingers.</p>

<p>On this night, as they sat in the yellow glow of a
birchwood fire which they had built in the chill of sunset,
Carter had drawn a rough map in the edge of the
ash. The somber depths of a moonless night lay like a
curtain of heavy velvet behind him, and against this his
thin and hawk-like face was set so vividly that Peter
saw the odd twitch of his lips as he said:</p>

<p>"One week for Jackson's Knee, another for the country
of Lac St. Joe, two more for the Height of Land,
and then you'll be looking down on Five Fingers!
They'll all be glad to see you, Peter. And Mona&mdash;&mdash;"
He shrugged his shoulders and a little throb came in
the pit of his throat when he spoke of Peter's sweetheart.
"God knows a man should be happy with a
girl like her waiting for him at the end of the trail."</p>

<p>"I've been away two years," replied Peter, for it was
always that thought which kept pounding at his heart.
"At times I am afraid of what may have happened
since that night you and Aleck Curry almost got dad
and me in the edge of the burned lands."</p>

<p>Carter made no sign that he had heard. He was
staring into the deep, red embers of the fire.</p>

<p>"Your mother was an angel," he said, so quietly and
unexpectedly that his words fell upon Peter almost with
the effect of a shock. "In the last of those days when
your father and I were shut up together by storm and
cold in the cabin, and he was accepting me as his son in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
his madness, he talked of her almost as if she were
alive and we were going home to her."</p>

<p>"She has been dead twenty years," said Peter.</p>

<p>"I know. Dead, and yet living. I can scarcely
believe that I hunted Donald McRae until I drove him
mad&mdash;for doing a thing which I would have done had
I stood in his shoes that day when he killed a man! It
was justice, Peter. My mother I cannot remember.
But <i>your</i> mother he made very near and real for me
in those last days of&mdash;I can't call it his madness!&mdash;it
was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forgetfulness," said Peter.</p>

<p>Carter bowed his head. "Yes, forgetfulness. Yet
some things lived so vividly&mdash;things of the past. He
made them live and breathe for me&mdash;and one picture
makes me want to kill!&mdash;that picture of the little cabin
in the clearing more than twenty years ago&mdash;your
mother&mdash;you in her arms&mdash;Donald McRae's homecoming
and the vengeance he dealt out to the snake
who had come to take advantage of his absence. When
I see that vision I want to choke the life out of a human
beast I know&mdash;Aleck Curry!"</p>

<p>Peter made no answer.</p>

<p>"I can't undo what I've done," Carter went on. "I
tracked your father until his mind broke under the
strain, but I can't help that now. It is over. All I can
do in the way of reparation is to help you&mdash;you and
Mona Guyon. And between you two&mdash;between your
happiness and hers&mdash;is one man, a slimy, conscienceless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
serpent, waiting and watching for your return."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;Aleck Curry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Aleck Curry."</p>

<p>Carter stood up, his tall, catlike form bathed in the
fire glow, and his hard lips were tightly closed as he
stared off into the darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>"Sounds queer&mdash;that word 'conscienceless' coming
from me," he mocked bitterly. "I've never had a conscience
or a heart in obeying the word of the law&mdash;but
I've never thought bad of a woman in the way Aleck
Curry thinks of Mona Guyon. He would sell his soul,
if he had one, to possess her&mdash;even if she came to him
for only an hour as the price of your safety and
freedom. And you're going home&mdash;<i>an outlaw</i>!"</p>

<p>"By that you mean Curry will hold me in his power
when I reach Five Fingers?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And will attempt to force from me a price&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter stood looking straight into Carter's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, partly from you, but mostly from Mona.
That is why I've been holding you back, a drag from
the beginning. Curry's uncle has become a power
politically, and Aleck was given a corporalship a year
ago. I would stake my life that he is keeping his secret
about you and the part you played in your father's
escape two years ago. The knowledge is too precious
for him to divulge. You assaulted him, almost killed
him, and freed your father; you kept him&mdash;an officer
of the law&mdash;a prisoner on an island; later you fired upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Curry and me with the rifle which Simon McQuarrie
gave you&mdash;and all this means from five to fifteen years
in prison for you, and Curry knows it. The fact that
your father was almost blind, and that his mind had
broken down, won't help you. Law is law, especially
in Canada. Our judges and juries go by the code and
not by emotions. And this law, its inviolability, is why
Aleck Curry is a greater menace to you now than all
the dangers you have encountered since you led your
father into the north.</p>

<p>"He is moved entirely by two passions, one his desire
for Mona Guyon and the other his hatred for you. On
the night when we almost caught you both in your
escape from Five Fingers he offered me a thousand dollars
and his uncle's influence in getting me a sergeancy
if I would keep the secret of your capture, and turn
our prisoners over to him. It was my humor to let
him think he had bought me. And then, in the dawn
of that morning, you filled our boat full of bullets&mdash;and
got way. That's the story, Peter. There is no escaping
the trap if you return to Five Fingers. Curry will
descend upon you, demand marriage of Mona, or probably
worse&mdash;and if she refuses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She can visit me occasionally in prison," said Peter.</p>

<p>His face reflected no trace of the white heat that had
mounted into Carter's; he spoke quietly and his hands
had lost their clenched tenseness. For a moment Carter
gazed at him in silence.</p>

<p>"You mean that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do. Aleck Curry holds no power over me that
can in any way endanger Mona. If I owe a debt, I am
willing to pay it. Neither Mona nor I have anything
that we want to sell, and Aleck Curry has nothing that
we want to buy."</p>

<p>Carter drew in a deep breath.</p>

<p>"If you look at it in that way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no other way."</p>

<p>"But Curry and I are the only two men on earth who
can swear that you have done these things. The
smallest restitution I can make to you for all the wrong
I have done your father is to keep my knowledge secret.
Torture could not tear it from me. Now&mdash;if we can
silence Curry, tie his tongue, break him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None of which we can do," interrupted Peter. "He
has hated me since the day we first fought over Mona
when we were boys. Only one thing could stop his
vengeance. I would have to kill him, and that is inconceivable.
For my father I would have done that. I
had even prepared myself to kill you, Carter, if such an
act became necessary to save him. But for myself&mdash;<i>no</i>!"</p>

<p>Carter thrust out his hand, but as it gripped Peter's
he turned his face away. "You're a lot like your dad,"
he said. "I see it more every day. I'm going to bed.
Good night!"</p>

<p>Caution and habit had made the ferret spread his
blankets in the pit of gloom outside the glow of firelight.
He disappeared in the darkness and a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
later Peter heard him as he stretched himself out for
the night.</p>

<p>But Carter had no idea of sleeping. For days past
a thought had been building itself up slowly in his
brain, and tonight he had almost revealed that thought
to Peter. He watched him now, and in the firelight the
drooped figure and pale, sensitive face of the man he
had hunted and whose happiness he had helped to
destroy tightened something at his heart until he found
it hard to breathe. He had never loved a woman, and
had never felt the bond of a great friendship for a man,
but for Peter something more than the friendship he
had known&mdash;a thing that was very close to a man's love
for a man&mdash;had begun to possess him body and soul.
In this one warm emotion of his cold and merciless life
Carter felt a deeper thrill than in the hour of his
greatest man-hunting triumph, and as he lay in
stillness, strengthening that thought which was becoming
a larger and more definite thing between Peter and
Mona and the tragedy which threatened them, his lips
parted in the grim and humorless smile which in all the
years of his service had made men fear and avoid him.</p>

<p>And with that smile, deadly and uncompromising,
Carter whispered to himself: "I guess maybe you
needn't worry, Peter. I don't think Aleck Curry and
the law are going to get you&mdash;not if I can help it."</p>

<p>With this settled, it was easier for Carter to give
himself up to sleep.</p>

<p>For a long time Peter sat near the fire. The birch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
logs burned down into a mass of coals, and as
deeper shadows closed in about the camp he felt himself
alone except for the visions which came and went in
the dying embers. With a clearness that brought
almost physical pain the years passed before his eyes,
and when they had gone they had taken with them his
boyhood, the father he had worshiped, his dreams and
happiness, leaving behind in the ash of the fire only
memories shadowed with the gloom of tragedy. But
calmly and with a courage inspired by his own grief he
was ready to accept what lay ahead of him. The fight,
as a physical thing, was over&mdash;and he was going home.
On that point his mind was fixed and no sense of self-preservation
could move it. What was to happen to
him when he reached Five Fingers was a matter which
Fate should decide.</p>

<p>Even in these moments of his decision he felt Mona's
nearness and her protest. If in defense of his father he
had become an outlaw, there was still a wide world in
which he could hide, and Mona would come to him. So
the persistent voice of caution whispered to him, and
at times that voice was Mona's.</p>

<p>Haggard-faced, Peter went to bed, and in the morning
it was Carter, cold and mechanically efficient, who
pointed out the same way to him.</p>

<p>But even as he pressed his reasoning home, Peter
observed there was a still deeper and more mysterious
change in his companion. It lay more in Carter's eyes
than in his voice or the unemotional lines of his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've learned how big the woods are," he said.
"Go north, into the Yukon or Alaska. I will see that
Mona comes to you&mdash;safely."</p>

<p>Peter shook his head.</p>

<p>"I've also learned what it means to run from thicket
to thicket, guarding a hunted thing you love. That
would be Mona's share&mdash;years of it, until the end.
And the end would come sometime. I'd rather pay the
debt&mdash;and have free years left to me afterward."</p>

<p>It was Carter's last effort. From that hour he
traveled steadily homeward with Peter, making no
protest against this new code which had come into his
life of giving, instead of taking, a tooth for a tooth
and an eye for an eye.</p>

<p>The middle of May found them halfway between
Lac St. Joe and the Height of Land, with Five Fingers
still a hundred and eighty miles ahead of them.</p>

<p>"We'll make it in seven days," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Unless the melting snows flood the streams," said
Carter.</p>

<p>Spring was breaking gloriously. Scents filled the
air. Crushed balsam and cedar gave out a redolence
that was tonic. The poplar buds were bursting. Birds
were returning. On the sides of slopes where the sun
struck warmly the snow was gone, grass sprang up lush
green, and flowers that budded while the earth was still
white began to bloom. Sap dripped from broken limbs,
and the whispered breath of a wakening life, of growing
things, and of matehood, hope and happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
seemed to rise between the earth and the sky, night
and day.</p>

<p>Both Peter and Carter sensed the thrill of these
things, yet neither felt their joy. The floods held them
back, so that at first their loss was in hours, and then
in days. Carter was glad, but he gave no betrayal of
that fact. His face in these last weeks had grown
quietly and splendidly different from the old Carter's.
It was cold, deeply lined, austere, but its sharpness was
mellowed and there was no longer the ferret-like gleam
in his eyes or the grim hardness in his lips and chin.
Not a day passed that his hand did not rest on Peter's
shoulder or arm, and in his touch was a gentleness that
at times was reflected in the look of his eyes. But in
the secrecy of his own thoughts was a dread of the day
they would arrive at Five Fingers. Dread&mdash;and yet
not fear.</p>

<p>Peter did not reveal his own fears except as they
became a part of his face and eyes in certain moments
which a man like Carter could not fail to observe.
These fears were not inspired by visions of personal
danger, for in adjusting his mind to the necessity of
paying his debt to the law he had eliminated the menace
of Aleck Curry in so far as it could possibly affect the
future of Mona or himself.</p>

<p>What he dreaded were the changes which nearly two
years might have brought to Five Fingers, and the evil
which Aleck Curry could have accomplished in that
time. Just what outrage his enemy could have successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
consummated he had no definite idea. Yet
the thought seized upon him at times and held him
under a dark and oppressive apprehension.</p>

<p>On the last day before crossing the Height of Land
Carter spoke of what he knew to be in Peter's mind.</p>

<p>"You will find Mona safe and well, and as true as
the day you left her," he said. "And lovelier, too,
Peter, for she needed these two years to round out her
glorious womanhood. I'm not worrying about her.
I'm putting all my faith in another gamble."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>Carter gave his thin shoulders a suggestive shrug.</p>

<p>"Has it occurred to you how nice it will be if&mdash;in
these two years of change you have anticipated&mdash;something
has happened to Curry? Death, for instance?"</p>

<p>Peter looked at his companion to see if he was joking.
Carter's face was set and unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he argued. "Aleck, although a brother
of the Devil, isn't calamity-proof. With him under six
feet of good, honest dirt, or mysteriously missing, or
kicked out of the force by an authority greater than his
uncle&mdash;you would be a free man, and Father Albanel
could ring the wedding bell the day you reach Five
Fingers. Maybe it's only a dream I've had&mdash;but I
seem to see Aleck Curry safely out of your way, now or
very soon. If he has tried to take advantage of Mona
Guyon during your absence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Simon McQuarrie or Pierre Gourdon would kill
him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly!" And Carter lighted his pipe and said no
more, nor did he raise his eyes to see the strained look
which he knew was in Peter's face.</p>

<p>That night they slept on the northward slope of the
ridge that separated the waterways of a continent.</p>

<p>Two days later, on the first of June, they crossed the
southern line of rail and camped in the deep wilderness
between it and Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Carter made his bed with more than usual care.</p>

<p>"Our last night," he said. "Tomorrow we should
pass the high ridge country before dark and reach Five
Fingers in the early light of the moon. Are you a little
excited?"</p>

<p>"I should like to go on," said Peter.</p>

<p>Carter smiled a bit wistfully. Now and then this
flash of gentleness had crept into his face of late. "I'd
be willing to give up the rest of my life if for a few
hours I could have someone waiting for me as Mona
Guyon is waiting for you," he answered in a low voice.
"Strange that I've let all the years go by without thinking
of that, isn't it? But I'm thinking now. And I'm
sorry&mdash;for a lot of things."</p>

<p>"You say you are going to resign from the police as
soon as you can," said Peter, looking into the darkness
that lay between him and home. "When you do that&mdash;come
to Five Fingers. Simon McQuarrie and Pierre
Gourdon and Joe and Father Albanel and all the others
will make it home for you. And Mona and Marie
Antoinette and Josette will love you because you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
four-square and helped <i>us</i>. And after that&mdash;somewhere&mdash;maybe
at Five Fingers&mdash;there will be a
girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A cough came from the gloom behind Peter, a thick
and husky cough as if Carter were choking something
back that was in his throat. "One of the few things I
remember from years ago is a song called 'The City
Four-Square,'" he said. "And when you, of all men,
call me four-square&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;" Darkness hid his face.
"Good night, Peter!"</p>

<p>"Good night," said Peter.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Carter</span>, as usual, had made his bed in deep
shadow, and there after a time he slept. The
moon rose, but still the shadow enveloped him, while
Peter lay in a glow of light when the man-hunter
roused himself. He looked at his watch and found the
hour a little after midnight. A second time he slept,
and a second time he awakened, and thick darkness had
come in place of the moonglow. This he knew to be
the dark prelude to dawn, and he rose out of his blanket
and crept cautiously away from the camp, moving a
foot at a time and making no sound. In a quarter of
an hour darkness and distance had swallowed him.
He waited then. Dawn broke first over the tree-tops
and filtered down softly and swiftly into the lower
depths of the forest until Carter could see to travel.
He lighted a last match to look at his watch and compass
and struck due south.</p>

<p>He traveled fast, free of pack and gun. Dawn grew
into the grayer softness of day. Peter would be awakening
now, he thought, or very soon. In an hour, or
two at the most, he would know he had been tricked.
Even with his advantage Carter sensed the thrill of an
impending race and the tragedy of it, if he should lose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Peter was swift and sure in the woods and it was a long
way to Five Fingers.</p>

<p>High up in the sky a fleet of white clouds took on a
crimson flush. The sun rose, and it found Carter's
face settling into the hard and grim lines of the hunter
whose game had so frequently been the lives of men.
In a small leather pouch he had stored some food, and
a part of this he ate as he traveled. He lost no time in
seeking log and driftwood dams to pave his way over
streams but plunged waist-deep into water that was still
cold with the chill of snow and ice. It was noon before
he stopped to rest and eat what was left of the food in
the leather pouch.</p>

<p>A second time a miracle of change swept over him,
and in his face, his eyes and the lithe swiftness with
which he moved he was the ferret again, hot on the
trail of game. Late in the afternoon he felt the cool
breath of Lake Superior in his face. The sun sank
lower. Dusk came. In the beginning of that dusk he
emerged from the last rim of the forest and stood with
the water of the big inland sea moaning under the dark
cliffs at his feet.</p>

<p>A sense of exultation and of triumph swept over
him. It was something to have mastered the wilderness
in this way and to have come out within half a dozen
miles of Five Fingers. Peter could not beat that, even
in this country which was his own.</p>

<p>Thickening darkness made these last miles more
difficult and for two hours Carter progressed slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
The sky was beautifully clear, but rocks and slides and
ragged cracks and pits at the cliff edge made his feet
wary, and countless stars only served to deepen their
shadows. When the moon came up he had reached the
huge cliff whose sheer walls rose two hundred feet
above the sea, less than half a mile from Five Fingers.</p>

<p>A last time he sat down, and with a strange smile on
his thin lips watched the full moon as it rose swiftly
over the forests, as if eager to reach its higher and more
permanent place in the arch of the heavens. He was
tired and wet and his clothes were torn. Until now,
when the settlement was only a step ahead, he had not
realized how exhausted he was or what a fight he had
gone through. Surely he had beaten Peter by many
miles and could afford to rest for a little while before
finishing his task!</p>

<p>His eyes closed in restful stillness. In half a dozen
minutes he could have slept, but each time that his body
wavered on the rock where he sat he forced himself
into rigid wakefulness. The temptation persisted, and
at last he gave himself five minutes and slept thirty.</p>

<p>The rattle of a stone roused him, and he gathered
himself up, blinking at the moon. Then he heard iron
nails scraping on rock. Instantly he was wide awake.
Someone was advancing along the face of the cliff
from the direction of Five Fingers. He could see first
the shadow of that person, growing in the illusive light
mist of moon and stars. It was big and grotesque and
the tread of its substance was slow and heavy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
heard a cough which was as unpleasantly heavy as the
tread, and a few steps more brought the advancing
figure to the little plateau of rock where he sat. Not
until then did he rise. The other stopped. The moon
laughed down into their faces. The stars seemed to
send upon them a more brilliant light. A dozen paces
separated them. Then, uncertainly, they shortened it
to half the distance. Carter's heart gave a great throb.
He would not have to go down to Five Fingers now,
<i>for this was his man</i>!</p>

<p>"Curry!" he greeted.</p>

<p>The other stared, half disbelieving. "Is that you&mdash;Carter?"
he gasped. He advanced again, peering into
the other's face. "By Heaven, <i>it is</i>!"</p>

<p>Carter was very white and thin and strange-looking
in the moonlight, and Aleck Curry was heavy and huge,
even to his neck and face. He thrust out a hand, but
Carter did not touch it.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me," he said, in a voice cold as ice. "Queer
why you should be coming this way, Curry. I was
going down there to find you."</p>

<p>Aleck's eyes pierced the blanket of moonlight behind
him. "What luck?" he asked. His voice thrilled with
nervous eagerness. He bent his big shoulders toward
Carter, looking into his face, his thick lips parted and
his narrow eyes gleaming anxiously as he tried to read
an answer before words came. "Any?"</p>

<p>Carter's slowness was an insult, and with that insult
his eyes and lips were smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I've had luck," he said, when the tenseness of
the other's silence seemed about to break. "Donald
McRae is dead, and Peter is back there&mdash;my prisoner!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Half an hour later, down in Five Fingers, the bell
over the little log church rang out sweetly and softly the
good news that Father Albanel had come in from his
monthly trip into the farther wilderness, and that
services would be held tomorrow, which was Sunday.
In the stillness of the night the music of the bell carried
far through the forests, creeping in and out and high
above the hidden places, bearing with it the peace and
gentleness of benediction and prayer to all things.</p>

<p>Peter heard it, far back in the hollows between the
ridges, and he paused to offer his gratitude to God for
this voice that was welcoming him home.</p>

<p>And at the edge of the cliff where the moonlight and
the starlight made a vivid arena of the table of rock its
message seemed to beat with the clearness of a silvery
drum. Then it stopped. Its echoes melted away,
and the two men who had heard it there remained
unchanged.</p>

<p>Carter seemed straighter and harder, his face more
like carven stone. But he was ready. And Aleck
Curry was like a huge gorilla gathering himself for a
leap.</p>

<p>"Carter&mdash;if you mean that&mdash;I'll kill you!" he said in
a voice that was thick with passion.</p>

<p>"I mean it," replied Carter, biting his words short.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
"I've taken the trouble to tell you the whole story. But
you can't understand and you never will. You're a
snake. You're a traitor to both justice and the law.
You think your power over Peter will give you vengeance
and something from Mona. But it won't. And I
warn you again that if you try to use your knowledge,
if you offer Peter as a price to Mona, if you give him
up to the law when she strikes you in the face&mdash;as she
will!&mdash;then I shall go to the highest authorities and
strip you to the skin. The truth will blast you. I will
tell how you offered me bribes, and then threatened; I
will tell of your affair in the home of Jacques Gautier
and expose the horrible trail you have left wherever
your slimy soul has gone. I shall investigate the death
of the young Indian girl on the Arrowhead. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish. Curry, the man who had waited,
the fiend who had kept the fires of hatred and passion
burning until they were madness, saw more than the
threatened ruin for himself. Reputation, family, his
place in the service meant nothing to him. What he
saw now in the white and almost deathlike face and
gleaming eyes of the Ferret was the end of the dream
he had built up&mdash;the end not only of his power over
Peter but of his last chance to possess Mona. If
Carter carried out his threat, if he told the story of
Gautier's wife and laid naked the truth of the Indian
girl's death on the Arrowhead&mdash;then all that he might
say against Peter would be discounted in the eyes of the
law, and punishment would fall upon himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>But he was not thinking of this punishment. At
times the evil mind in his heavy head worked with
amazing swiftness&mdash;and in this last moment of Carter's
threat and defiance he saw the yawning abyss of the
cliff behind the Ferret, and its overwhelming temptation.
With Carter down there, dead, and Peter walking
straight into the trap at Five Fingers, his own
power and triumph would be more complete than he
had ever dreamed it could be&mdash;<i>for he would make
Peter also the Ferret's murderer</i>!</p>

<p>The moon revealed the monstrous thought that
leaped like flame into his face, and it was then Carter
cut his words short to meet the avalanche of flesh and
fury that descended upon him.</p>

<p>Swift as a flash he sensed Curry's intention of
throwing him over the cliff, and twined his arms about
his enemy's neck as they crashed upon the rock. For a
moment after that a great shadow of fear darkened the
Ferret's soul. A hundred times in their associations on
the trail he had witnessed the tests and measured the
possibilities of Aleck's huge body and herculean
strength. And now he was at death grips with it.
That day he had seen a wood-mouse in the fangs of a
weasel, and he was the wood-mouse now. And then he
thought of Peter&mdash;of Peter and Mona and the battle at
the pool two years ago when they had beaten this great
hulk of a man. Fear went out of him. His biggest
thrill in life was in the main chance against death.
And this was the biggest of all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>A queer thought shot into his head, a surging back
of his old pride. He was not the wood-mouse, nor was
he the weasel. He was the <i>ferret</i>, and Aleck Curry was
an unknown beast, ponderous and mighty, but with that
vulnerable spot which the ferret always found in its
prey. And this time Carter knew he was fighting for
more than himself. He was fighting for a man who
was dead, and whose spirit was there on the rock
watching them. He was fighting for Peter. And he
was fighting for a woman.</p>

<p>His thin arms and legs fastened themselves about
Aleck like things made of wire steel instead of flesh and
bone. Over and over they rolled, twisting, bending,
breaking, heads and faces gouging on the rocks, and
always Carter's quickness made up for the other's
weight and strength.</p>

<p>Their breath came in panting gasps as the nails in
their boots struck fire from the rock. A moan of
anguish came from Curry when Carter got the terrible
thumb gouge in his eye, and a gasp of agony from the
Ferret when Aleck bent his head back until his neck
nearly broke. There was something merciless and
horrible in the struggle.</p>

<p>A little cloud ran under the face of the moon. It
was followed by a larger and darker one, as if spirit
hands were drawing a curtain between it and the
tragedy on the rock. The light of the stars seemed to
grow dimmer, as if they, too, shrank from this thing
that was happening between the sea and the sky. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
over the edge of the cliff came a wailing sob of wind
that was already beginning to croon its death song for
the victim. Minutes were hours. Gasps, chokings,
blows and the panting of breaths were the ticking of the
seconds. Moments of stillness, when the two lay
crumpled and twisted as if they had died together, were
like eternities. And foot by foot they had rolled until
they were close to the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>Then it was that a shudder of deeper horror seemed
to creep through the night. A black cloud swept under
the moon, hiding entirely what was happening at the
cliff's edge, and this cloud moved away with appalling
slowness. When the moon looked out again one object
remained where there had been two. For a long time
it lay crumpled there, sobbing for breath. Then it
crawled away slowly, dragging itself painfully over
the rock, and disappeared at last into the thick
growth of the burned-over lands which reached far
to the north.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under that same moon, hours later, Peter came to the
edge of Five Fingers. Out of the sky all sign of cloud
was gone and the stars glowed in radiant constellations.
Peter knew that it was midnight, and as he looked down
from the crest of the slope, where he had first walked
hand in hand with Mona when he was a boy, a strange
and gentle silence rose up from the bottom-lands to
greet him. Five Fingers was asleep. He could see no
light and at first he heard no sound. Then came to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the old familiar tinkle of silver bells on distant cattle,
and the soft murmur of the sea that was never quite
still where it ran in and out among the rocks of the
Pit at the end of Middle Finger Inlet.</p>

<p>For a space he stood looking down where the dark
shadows of the cabins lay in a great pool of mellow
light that was like a gossamer mist of silver and gold.
His heart beat fast, so fast that he clutched a hand at
his breast and swallowed hard to get his breath. Down
there, within sound of his voice, was Mona&mdash;and all at
once his manhood seemed to leave him and he wanted
to shout wildly through his hands like a boy, calling
her name, rousing her from sleep, shrieking at the top
of his voice that he had come back. A sort of thrilling
madness possessed him, but of all his desire only a
choking sob rose in his throat.</p>

<p>He walked down the slope and he saw Pierre
Gourdon's home among the scattered cabins. It was
there he would find Mona, if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His heart skipped a beat. If anything had happened,
<i>anything</i>&mdash;sickness&mdash;accident&mdash;if she had gone away!
Two years was a long time. Two years might have
brought&mdash;a change.</p>

<p>His feet seemed to stumble, and then suddenly he
stopped, and a cry came to his lips. For he had come
to the smooth little patch of green meadow where Mona
had made the men of Five Fingers bury the scores of
marauding porcupines they killed each year, and he saw
here and there freshly made little mounds of soil. Near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
one of these, which was scarcely dried by a day's sun,
was a spade. Eagerly he seized it in his hands. It was
<i>their</i> spade, with its broken edge and the iron rod
handle which Simon had put on it to replace the wooden
one which porcupines had eaten away. Mona was in
Five Fingers! She was alive&mdash;well&mdash;sleeping in her
little room where he had visioned her at prayer every
night of his life!</p>

<p>He took off his pack and dropped it near the freshly
made mound. Then he went on, and stopped under
Mona's window.</p>

<p>It was partly open. He could hear the soft flutter
of a curtain in the breath of wind that came up from
the shore. Almost afraid to break the stillness he called
her name in a low voice.</p>

<p>"<i>Mona!</i>"</p>

<p>The curtain fluttered back at him. It seemed to be
laughing at him, seemed to be signaling to him like a
hand from the window.</p>

<p>Then he saw on their nails against the log wall the
long bamboo poles which Pierre Gourdon used in his
fishing. A hundred times when he had come in from
the woods late at night he had tapped at Mona's window
with one of these poles, and she had thrust out her
head to blow him down a kiss and say good night.
And now, with two hearts seeming to beat in his breast
in place of one, he seized one of the poles and gently
tapped the old signal on the window-pane. And
all at once the curtain ceased its fluttering and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
could hear the two hearts pounding mightily against
his ribs.</p>

<p>He tapped again&mdash;<i>tap-tap-tappety-tap!</i> and stepped
back into the deep shadow that hung around the edge
of the Gourdon cabin in a heavy fringe.</p>

<p>Someone came to the window. He knew it&mdash;yet he
could not see straight up above his head. He held himself
back, waiting for some response to his signal. In a
moment he would step out in the moonlight, and
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He heard the curtain fluttering again. Sound came
from her room. It continued for a few moments, and
ceased with the quiet opening of a door. Then he heard
footsteps, quick, light, almost frightened footsteps, and
a slim figure came around the end of Pierre Gourdon's
cabin and stood white-faced and trembling in the moonlight.</p>

<p>It was Mona&mdash;Mona as he had left her an hour ago&mdash;yesterday&mdash;two
years ago&mdash;unchanged&mdash;except that
she seemed taller to him, more beautiful. She had
thrown a long cloak about her and he could see her
hand clutching it at the throat as her wide eyes strained
to solve the mystery which the misty chaos of the
moonlight was hiding from her. For a space he
seemed powerless to move. Then he tried to speak as
he revealed himself, ragged and torn and bronzed to
Indian darkness by his long fight through the wilderness,
but it was only an incoherent cry that stumbled
on his lips. Mona saw him. For an instant she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
swayed like a tall flower, with the whiteness of lily
petals in her face as he went to her. And then she
gave a cry that even Pierre Gourdon might have heard
if he had not slept so deeply&mdash;and Peter's arms closed
about her.</p>

<p>A minute later she held back his face with her two
hands. Her eyes were filled with the glory of the stars
and her lips were red with the wild, sweet passion of
their kisses. Slowly a shadow came, and with it an
unutterable tenderness in the words which she whispered
to him:</p>

<p>"Peter, <i>I knew</i>. Carter sent me word&mdash;about your
father&mdash;and <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She drew his head down until she was holding it
against her breast. Her heart beat against his cheek.
Her lips kissed his hair.</p>

<p>"Only you&mdash;you and God&mdash;know how sorry I am,"
she whispered.</p>

<p>And Peter felt once more like the small boy in the
edge of the forest years ago, when Mona had come to
him in the dusk of evening to mend his broken heart.
For in these first moments of his homecoming it was
Mona&mdash;again&mdash;who thought first of his grief, and not
of her own happiness; and holding his head close,
pressing his rough cheek in the palm of her soft hand,
she told him how Carter had sent word to her all the
way down through the wilderness, and how she had
kept Carter's message to herself&mdash;as he had asked her
to do&mdash;and had waited night and day for his coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
with prayers of gratitude in her heart, and sorrow for
him.</p>

<p>"And Carter promised to bring you to me," she
whispered, "because he said that in the end he had
learned to love your father&mdash;and you."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 2em;"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> the shadow of Pierre Gourdon's cabin
fell deepest a man had dragged himself and lay
like a dark and lifeless blot. Since Peter had tapped at
the window this man had scarcely moved, except to
breathe and change his position a little as he watched
the lovers out in the light of the moon and stars.
They were very near to him, so near he might have
touched them with a pole less than the length of that
which Peter had used. And he heard the girl speak of
Carter, and of what Carter had done.</p>

<p>It was then he drew himself slowly away, moving
with the stealth and caution of one to whom freedom
from discovery meant a great deal. Not until the cabin
was fully between him and those he had spied upon did
he rise to his feet. This movement was slow and
brought a gasp of pain from him. He did not stand
straight. His shoulders were bent. He was hatless
and ragged and his arms and breast were half stripped
of clothing. In his hand he carried a heavy stick, and
with this stick he helped himself to walk as he struck
out in the moonlight.</p>

<p>He tried to hurry, but at best his progress was not
fast, and to make up for lack of speed he kept the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
between him and the two from whom he was running
away. In the shadow of a second cabin he stopped to
rest, breathing deeply, as if what he had accomplished
had cost him great effort. One at a time he passed the
dwellings in the settlement and made his way across
the green open to the little log church. Here he rested
for a longer period, and in these moments he noted
with satisfaction that trees threw a deep and continuous
shadow between him and the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>The door of Father Albanel's church was never
locked and after a little he opened it and entered. But
he bolted it carefully behind him. Then he groped his
way through the moonlit seats and opened a window.
After that he found the rope which rang the bell.</p>

<p>Never in its history had Five Fingers roused itself
to the ringing of the bell as it was rung tonight. It
was not the Sabbath message. It was not Father
Albanel's sweet, slow tolling of peace on earth and
good will toward men, nor was it the sad and
slumberous requiem for the dead. It was, instead, a
wild exultation, an almost savage triumph, a pealing
alarm that called upon every soul in the settlement to
rise up in instant wakefulness. It filled the forest until
its notes beat one upon another and the hills and ridges
caught them up and flung them back as they had never
done before. Men rose out of their sleep and stumbled
for matches; a light appeared here, another there, and
still the bell continued to ring until not a cabin in Five
Fingers remained in darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Not until then did the man who had rung the bell
drop from the window of the little church and steal
through the shadows of the trees into the forest.
There he did not pause but went on with the slowness
of either age or exhaustion until he was swallowed in
the deeper secrecy of the woods.</p>

<p>Pierre Gourdon came first out into the night, bareheaded
and in his shirt-sleeves, and in front of his cabin
he found Mona ahead of him with her long hair
streaming down her back and a strange man's arms
tightly about her. Almost fiercely he tore them apart&mdash;and
then he saw it was Peter.</p>

<p>Jame Clamart came running up a moment later, and
it was Jame who first sent the news abroad in a shout
which, next to the mad ringing of the bell, was the
wildest thing ever heard in Five Fingers between the
hour of midnight and one o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"Peter McRae has come back!" he yelled. "Peter
McRae&mdash;<i>has</i>&mdash;<i>come</i>&mdash;<i>back</i>!"</p>

<p>Swifter almost than men could travel word passed
that this was the reason for the ringing of the bell&mdash;Peter
McRae had come home after two years, and
Father Albanel, or some other, had wakened them from
their sleep to welcome him.</p>

<p>Pierre's women were first to take Peter away from
Mona&mdash;Josette, coming first, and then Marie Antoinette.
And after them came Adette Clamart. When
she saw Peter she gave a little screech and threw her
arms around his neck, kissing him before her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
and all, and then she fell upon Mona and cried hard in
her gladness. The little group grew larger; voices,
glad laughter, tremulous excitement filled the air, but
suddenly a hush fell as a tall and gaunt-faced figure
stalked up through the silvery haze of the night and
old Simon McQuarrie shouldered his way among them.</p>

<p>He said nothing when he came face to face with
Peter, but for a moment held him off at arm's length,
his stern face working in a strange sort of way, and
then, as Mona crept to his side, he clasped them both
in his arms and stood for a few moments with his head
bowed close down to theirs.</p>

<p>And then a whisper of gladness ran among the
women, for Father Albanel stood beside Mona and
Peter and the little gray missioner's face was streaming
with tears of happiness as he, too, put his arms
gently about them.</p>

<p>"It was Father Albanel who rang the bell," the
women whispered softly among themselves.</p>

<p>And to this day the people of Five Fingers believe
that he did.</p>

<p>But on this night, Father Albanel was neither
crooked nor bent, nor did he walk with the aid of a
stick.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To Peter it was like a dream, a glorious dream of
friendship and of a love that lifted his soul above all
thought of fear and tragedy, and not until he was alone
with Simon in the cabin which had been his home for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
so many years before he went away with his father did
he think of Aleck Curry or of the payment he had promised
himself to be ready to make to the law. But the
thing which happiness had held back came out now.</p>

<p>The old Scotchman heard Peter's story from the
night of the flight almost two years ago, when the
forests were burning in the great fire about Five
Fingers. And then Peter learned, in turn, that Aleck
Curry had built himself a shack in the edge of the
timber and was quite frequently at Five Fingers,
usually remaining for a week or two at a time. He was
there now. That very evening Simon had met him face
to face in company with one of the half-dozen government
surveyors who for a year or more had been working
up and down the shore. He was surprised that the
ringing of the bell and the excitement had not brought
Curry upon the scene. Probably he was with the surveyors
at their camp. Tomorrow he would show up.</p>

<p>"And you haven't any idea what became of Carter?"
Simon asked.</p>

<p>Peter shook his head. "He simply disappeared. I
cannot guess why. Maybe he, too, will show up
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Peter, who rang the bell?"</p>

<p>Peter flushed under his darkened skin. "I think
Father Albanel saw Mona and me in the moonlight.
He always loved to wander about late at night, when
the moon was bright."</p>

<p>Simon's gaunt face broke into a strange smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"It wasn't Father Albanel who rang the bell," he
said.</p>

<p>"No?" Peter looked at him sharply. "Then it was
you, Simon! You saw us?"</p>

<p>"No. I was asleep&mdash;sound asleep. But I know who
rang the bell. It was Carter!"</p>

<p>A little thrill leaped through Peter. "It is impossible.
Carter would not have run away from me for
<i>that</i>. Besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish, for Simon had risen and was looking
out through the window in a way that puzzled him.</p>

<p>"I'm going down to the church," he said. "And I'm
going the back way, along the edge of the woods, so
that no one will see me. Want to go?"</p>

<p>They stole forth through the moonlight into the
shadows of the forest. When they came to the church
Simon tried the door.</p>

<p>"Locked!" he said. "That is unusual!"</p>

<p>A few seconds later they stood at the open window.
Through this they climbed and one after another the
Scotchman lighted a dozen matches until they knew
that no one could have remained hidden inside. Simon
then closed the window and led the way out through the
door, leaving it unlocked.</p>

<p>"Careless of him," he grunted. "We'll leave the
place just as he found it. Fewer questions will be
asked."</p>

<p>He did not speak again until they were once more in
their own cabin. Peter, feeling the completeness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
exhaustion now, was about to ascend the ladder to his
own bed when Simon rested a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Boy," he whispered, "whatever happens after this,
forget that Carter came down from the north with you
and that he ran away from you back there on the trail.
Understand, laddie? <i>Forget it!</i> Lie about it if you
have to. For I believe it was Carter who rang that bell
tonight, and if he did, and it should so turn out that
something has happened to Aleck Curry&mdash;why&mdash;you
see&mdash;it might be a suspicious circumstance, pointing to
a thing which you and I, with God's blessing on us,
will always know could never be true!"</p>

<p>Even these words, making significantly clear the
suspicion which was in Simon's mind, could not keep
Peter from thinking of Mona, and of Mona alone,
when he went to bed. But he awoke with the first
crowing of Simon McQuarrie's roosters, three hours
later. He was going to take breakfast with Mona, he
told Simon, and as he was an appalling mess he needed
a lot of time to prepare for it. For two hours he
scrubbed and shaved and shampooed and manicured
himself, and then dressed in the best outfit he had left
behind him two years ago.</p>

<p>It was only a quarter of six when he finished, but
an hour before, he had seen a light in Mona's room and
now smoke was rising from the chimney over Josette
Gourdon's kitchen.</p>

<p>He went out the back way, as he and Simon had gone
a few hours earlier, and was sure he had succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
coming up behind Pierre's cabin without giving any
evidence of himself. But Mona's eyes were bright and
her cheeks were flushed as he stood very still for a few
moments in the doorway, though her back was toward
him, and she seemed to be absorbed in a number of
purposeless little details at the kitchen table. Peter
made no sound, unless the pounding of his heart could
be called that.</p>

<p>There was a change after all&mdash;a change which the
silvery radiance of the moon had veiled from him last
night. Mona <i>was</i> taller, and&mdash;even as he was looking
at her now, without clearly seeing her face&mdash;she was
so much lovelier than when he had left Five Fingers
that he was a little frightened. Carter was right. It
had taken those two years to make her even more beautiful
than Marie Antoinette. And he continued to stand
where he was, thinking himself undiscovered, worshiping
her in silence from the heels of her little feet to
the top of her lustrous head as if a word or a movement
from him would destroy the transcendent reality
of it all.</p>

<p>Mona's cheeks grew pinker and her eyes brighter.</p>

<p>Then she turned upon him so suddenly and with such
an unexpected knowledge of his presence filling her
eyes with laughter and joy that in one swift moment
Peter had her in his arms, and kissed her so wildly
on eyes and lips and hair that she was compelled to hide
her face against his breast to get breath.</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;breaking me," she protested. "You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
grown so strong, Peter. And you are tumbling my hair
down that I put up with so much care, because this is
Sunday!"</p>

<p>She leaned back and shook her head so that the
loosened coils of her hair flooded down about her
shoulders in a radiant protest to her words.</p>

<p>"The two happiest days of my life have been Sundays,"
he said, holding her more gently.</p>

<p>"This is one, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the other?" she asked, as if she had forgotten
it entirely.</p>

<p>"Was that first day you took me to church, when I
thought you were a little white angel, and sang with
you, and dared to take a tress of your hair in my
fingers when I thought you didn't know it."</p>

<p>"And since that day I've loved you, Peter. Yes, I
loved you in that very hour when you bit Aleck Curry's
ear!"</p>

<p>He filled his hands with the loosened masses of her
hair, crushing the soft coils between his fingers.</p>

<p>"<i>Kiss me.</i>"</p>

<p>"Sh-h!" She put a finger to his lips. "It is Aunt
Josette! I hear her coming! I must run up the back
way and fix my hair!"</p>

<p>"It is unthoughtful of Aunt Josette&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she is coming!"</p>

<p>"<i>Kiss me!</i>"</p>

<p>She pressed her warm lips to his, and he let her go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Scarcely had she escaped when Josette's light footsteps
sounded in the dining-room, and a moment later she
appeared in the kitchen. Peter was stirring pancake
batter.</p>

<p>"Mona gave me this job," he tried to explain.
"She'll be back in a minute."</p>

<p>Josette smiled at him sweetly, and then quite innocently
picked up several hairpins from the floor.
"How careless of me to lose these!" she exclaimed, but
there was a roguish light in her dark eyes which did
not quite escape Peter as she tucked the pins in her own
thick tresses.</p>

<p>To Peter it was as if he had gone away yesterday,
and returned today. Pierre came in yawning, and
found him helping with the breakfast. When Mona
reappeared her hair was in a long braid. Never had he
seen such lovely, velvety softness in her eyes or such
sweet color in her face.</p>

<p>Josette, with a sly signal to Pierre, maneuvered them
to the open door. "When we are ready for you children
we'll call you," she said.</p>

<p>They walked toward the forest. And there, in the
edge of the beautiful green meadow which had always
been hallowed as their playground, he saw for the first
time a new cabin nearly finished. Mona was looking at
him. She saw the surprise and then the cloud that
gathered in his face. She took his hand, and her
fingers clung to his.</p>

<p>"You don't like it?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a nice cabin, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not know how to finish. She looked down,
very demurely, so that he could not see her eyes for the
long lashes that hid them.</p>

<p>"It is my cabin."</p>

<p>"<i>Yours!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, mine. Maybe I shouldn't tell you the secret,
Peter, but I'm going to be married."</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that a human heart could rise
up and choke one as quickly as Peter's did.</p>

<p>Mona was still looking at the ground.</p>

<p>"You see, Carter told me in his letter to confide in
Simon. And when Simon knew you were coming,
and would of course have to marry me very soon, we
planned this cabin together and Simon is going to give
it to me as a wedding present. Then I'm going to let
you live in it. Don't you think I'm nice?"</p>

<p>Peter stopped. Mona looked up, frightened.</p>

<p>"Don't, Peter&mdash;don't!" she entreated. "Aunt Josette
is looking, and Uncle Pierre will see you, and all the rest
of Five Fingers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But all the rest of the world could not have stopped
Peter. He crumpled her in his arms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That day was one in which Peter could not bring
himself to reveal to Mona the uncertainty which had
been a part of his homecoming. Her happiness completely
possessed him, and as hour after hour passed he
found himself further than at the beginning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
carrying out his resolution to tell her the price which
he fully expected the law would ask of him. That he
could expect no mercy from Aleck Curry, he assured
himself through Simon. But he did not see Aleck, nor
did he mention him to Mona. She sensed no danger.
No one in Five Fingers could guess at the menace
which hung over him, for he believed that even Simon
did not know of that first morning of his father's
flight when he had committed the fatal sin of firing
upon the law. From the fact that Aleck had kept this
crime a secret he realized the nearness and deadliness of
the trap which would soon spring upon him.</p>

<p>But Aleck did not appear. It was not until after
morning service in the little church that Mona mentioned
him quite casually. He was bigger and coarser
and more detestable than ever, she told Peter. He had
tried to pay some attention to her, and she knew that he
and Simon had frequently had words. It was through
his uncle, she said, that he had been given this lazy
assignment, covering the country between the railroad
settlements and Five Fingers.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Peter met Simon alone.</p>

<p>The lines in the old Scotchman's face seemed to have
grown deeper since morning. They were like little
creases cut in stone.</p>

<p>"I have been over to the surveyors' camp," he said.
"Curry hasn't been there since yesterday morning.
And he didn't sleep in his bed last night."</p>

<p>"He has gone to the settlements," suggested Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"His pack and traveling dunnage are in his shack,"
answered Simon. "He hasn't gone to the settlements."
Simon did not once let his eyes meet Peter's squarely.
He spoke even carelessly as he looked away. "You
haven't forgotten what I told you about Carter?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That is well. I wouldn't be surprised if something
happened to Curry last night. I saw him dead drunk
at dusk&mdash;starting out alone along the cliff to the west.
I told him to come back, and he cursed me."</p>

<p>Simon McQuarrie could not hide a lie. And Peter
knew he was lying.</p>

<p>A little later Simon struck off into the woods to the
east and did not return until after dark. At bedtime
Peter asked if he had found anything of interest.</p>

<p>"Only a hungry man. I happened to have a lunch in
my pocket. The poor devil was so weak he was hobbling
along with a stick."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask his name." Simon turned his back to
Peter as he prepared for bed. "Queer I didn't ask his
name&mdash;but I didn't."</p>

<p>On the third day after this night Five Fingers
received a stupendous shock. Simon McQuarrie and
Father Albanel, in seeking lost net buoys under the
Big Cliff, had found the body of a dead man. It was
Aleck Curry. He was terribly broken and almost
unrecognizable by the pounding of his body in the surf
that washed in and out among the rocks. The story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
his end was quite clear. He had evidently stumbled
over the edge of the cliff while drunk, inasmuch as
Simon had seen him staggering in its direction on the
night he had disappeared.</p>

<p>"We'll take him to the nearest railroad settlement
and let his friends have him," Simon said to the men of
Five Fingers.</p>

<p>But to Father Albanel he added, in a voice which
others did not hear, "It would be unpleasant, <i>mon père</i>,
to have him always in our own little cemetery where
only those we love are at rest."</p>

<p>And so, on that same day, all that was left of Aleck
Curry was borne northward through the hills and
ridges to his people.</p>

<p>Three weeks later Mona and Peter were married.
Five Fingers will never forget that day. It was in the
full glory of June, and the robins and thrushes were
singing outside the little church. In spite of Peter's
protest Mona teased him by insisting that she would
not tell him where she wanted to spend her honeymoon
until the little missioner had said the last words, and
they were man and wife. And then, putting her soft
mouth to Peter's ear, she whispered, "I want to stay in
the new cabin which Simon is giving us."</p>

<p>So there, from the beginning, they found their new
happiness, and Pierre Gourdon and Josette would walk
in the twilights of summer evenings, lovers still, and
never grow tired of painting for each other the beautiful
and unforgetable pictures of many years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
when they had come through the pathless wilderness
to make this paradise in which God, in His great goodness,
had made the last of their dreams come true.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on an afternoon in August that Adette
Clamart came to Mona's home with her cousin, Adele,
who had come from the French country of Quebec to
live with her, and announced that a stranger had
arrived in Five Fingers and was talking with Simon
in his cabin.</p>

<p>"Adele met him on the settlement trail," she said.
"He carried a basket of flowers for her, and was so
very nice that she has fallen in love with him. Haven't
you, Adele?"</p>

<p>"He was very stiff and frightened every time I
looked at him," replied Adele, "and I felt sorry for
him. But he was nice&mdash;yes. And he had&mdash;how do I
say it, Adette?&mdash;such a strange, stern face, with sadness
in it&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered Adette. "He was dangerously
hungry, Adele. I know because Jame gets that way."</p>

<p>"Whoever he is&mdash;<i>he is coming</i>!" said Mona, looking
through the open door.</p>

<p>And so he was, with the old Scotchman on one side
of him and Peter on the other, as if they were pulling
him along against his will. And as they came nearer
Mona's heart gave a sudden flutter, and then a great
jump, for this stranger who had carried Adele's
flowers was Carter the man-hunter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>She ran out to meet him, and though she said only a
few trembling words of welcome a light which Carter
saw in her eyes made him draw in a quick breath of
gratitude and joy.</p>

<p>"The new superintendent of the mill," announced
Simon a little pompously, when Adette and Adele had
joined them. "I'm getting lazy and he is taking
my place. Quite a surprise! But we've been planning
it a long time, haven't we, Carter?" And
Simon laughed mysteriously.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden interruption. The bell over the
little church began to ring as it had rung on a certain
midnight weeks ago. And this time it was surely
Father Albanel who was tugging at the rope. In his
face was a flush of benevolent joy, and the louder the
bell rang the rosier his cheeks grew, and there alone in
the church he laughed like a boy.</p>

<p>Nudging Carter, whose face had grown strangely
fixed and staring, Simon McQuarrie chuckled softly at
his shoulder: "Someone rang the bell like that on the
night Peter came home. And <i>now</i>, Carter, it is ringing
our welcome to <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>Observing Mona a few moments later, Adette wondered
what had happened to make her eyelashes wet
with tears.</p>

<p>Peter understood, and his hand found Mona's and
held it tenderly. With an inspiration born of words
which Carter had once said to him about a girl waiting
at the end of the trail, he found the opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
whisper, "Ask Carter to have supper with us, and also
<i>Adele</i>."</p>

<p>This Mona did in her own sweet fashion, making
sure of Carter first, and after his acceptance calling
upon Adele to lend herself to his entertainment in a
way which gave her no possible excuse for a refusal,
had such a thought come into her mind. Simon looked
shrewdly at Mona and Adette. Then he turned toward
the green ridges to the north over which billowy white
clouds were rising.</p>

<p>"It's going to rain," he said. "I smell it in the air.
It will come tonight."</p>

<p>"The crops need it," said Peter.</p>

<p>"And most of all&mdash;the flowers," added Adele, looking
at Carter.</p>

<p>"Yes, the flowers&mdash;and the woods," he nodded. "It
is very dry in the timber for this season of the year."</p>

<p>Mona and Peter turned toward their cabin, and
Mona's eyes shot a sly signal to Adette. Jame's wife
took firm hold of Simon's arm. "If you know what is
good for you&mdash;come with me!" she whispered, with
her back turned to Adele and Carter.</p>

<p>For a moment Carter stood helplessly. Then he
moved to Adele's side and they followed Mona and
Peter.</p>

<p>"You like flowers, Miss Adele?"</p>

<p>"I love them, Mr. Carter!"</p>

<p>As they passed through the door Mona squeezed her
husband's hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a wonderful thought, Peter. Do you think
you can kiss me very quickly before they come in?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that I can," replied Peter&mdash;and kissed
her.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
